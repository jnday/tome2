## More Or Less

This is an extension of the work done on modernizing building Tales of Middle Earth (ToME) 2.3.5 for Windows by AnonymousHero at <https://github.com/Tome2/Tome2>.  
ToME 2.3.5 was created by darkgod at <https://te4.org/> a long time ago.  He's on version 4 now, and it's free and awesome.
Special thanks to <https://github.com/jkatzmewing> for understanding what I was looking for and providing the exact version I needed.

You should be able to build this using CMake on Windows 10.  I used Visual Studio 2019.  Let me know how this works for you, I'm new to it all.

I've grabbed a lot of the wiki as it exits on <https://www.archive.org/>.  You can find it in the docs folder. This area could use attention.  
I'd love to find old forum posts, there was a LOT of information there on character builds and tactics.
