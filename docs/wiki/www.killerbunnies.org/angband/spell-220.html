<h1>The (Not Yet) Comprehensive ToME 2.2.x Spell Spoiler</h1>
<p><i><small>[Last modified 2005-11-05.  See
<a href="#changelog">below</a> for recent changes.]</small></i>
<p>
This spoiler attempts to describe quantitatively the effects of all
player-castable spells in the 2.2.0 thru 2.2.7 release versions of ToME.
It is an outgrowth of my <a href="skill-220.html">ToME skill spoiler</a>;
trying to include all this information in the skill spoiler just made it
too verbose, so I broke it out into this new spoiler.
<p>
<i>[<strong>NOTE:</strong>  This spoiler is (intended to be) correct for
ToME v2.2.0 thru  v2.2.7.  For information on later ToME versions, see the
<a href="spell-230.html">2.3.x version</a> of this spoiler.</i>

<h2><a name="notation">Terminology and notation</a></h2>
<p>
<a name="effect">The primary determiner</a> of a spell's effect is the
spell's <i>spell effect level</i>, denoted&nbsp;E; E&nbsp;is computed as
your skill level in the spell's school minus the level of the spell, plus
one, plus any bonuses conferred by your equipment or (depending on the
spell school) your <a href="#spellpower">Spell-power skill</a>.  This level
is the number displayed in the "Level" column when browsing spellbooks.
For most purposes, E&nbsp;is rounded down to the nearest integer; where
necessary, we will use&nbsp;Eu to denote the unrounded value.
<p>
We also define a "scaled" spell effect level (E@N), defined as
(Eu&times;N)/50, rounded down to the nearest integer.  As a further
refinement, we define (E@N:M) to be the larger of (E@N) and&nbsp;M.
<p>
Further notation:
<ul>
<li> A&times;B denotes multiplication; for instance 5&times;6 evaluates
to&nbsp;30.
<li> NdM is the standard "dice" notation; for instance, 3d6 denotes the sum
of three independent uniformly distributed random integers from&nbsp;1
to&nbsp;6, or three six-sided dice.  For more complicated forms, we will
use parentheses, as in (A&times;B)d(C+D/2).
</ul>
<h2><a name="effects">Spell effects</a></h2>
<p>
Some spell effects will require some additional description, both of their
effects and of how they will be denoted in spell descriptions.  All effect
durations are specified as multiples of 10&nbsp;game turns (equivalent to
one player turn at normal speed).
<ul>
<li>
A <i>targeted effect</i> denotes a bolt, beam or ball effect that can be
targeted at a particular square with the targeting command '<tt>*</tt>', or
can be cast in one of the eight cardinal directions and will affect the
first monster hit (except for beams, which will continue through).  For
ball effects, the targeted or affected location will be the center of the
ball.
<li>
A <a name="ball"><i>ball effect</i></a> will be described with a radius and
a base damage.  It does the base damage at the center of the ball, half
damage at squares of distance&nbsp;1 from the center, one-third damage at
squares of distance&nbsp;2 from the center, and so on up to the specified
radius.
<li>
A <a name="cloud"><i>cloud effect</i></a> will be described with a radius,
a base damage and a duration.  Initially, a <a href="#ball">ball effect</a>
is performed with the specified radius and base damage; every 10&nbsp;game
turns after that for the specified duration, full base damage is done at
each square affected by the initial ball effect, if it is currently in the
player's line of sight.  [The line-of-sight requirement is intended to
prevent a tactic considered cheesy by the game designers:  step briefly
into line of sight of a bunch of dangerous monsters, cast a cloud-effect
spell, then duck back out of line of sight and wait safely while the cloud
effect kills off the monsters.]
<li>
A <a name="wave"><i>wave effect</i></a> will be described with an initial
radius, a base damage and a duration.  Initially, a <a href="#ball">ball
effect</a> is performed with the initial radius and specified base damage,
and the initial radius is stored as a variable&nbsp;R; every 10&nbsp;game
turns after that for the specified duration, all squares in line of sight
of the player that are of distance&nbsp;R or&nbsp;R+1 from the original
center of the effect take full base damage, and R&nbsp;is incremented
by&nbsp;1.  The wave effect has some variants:
  <ul>
  <li>
  In a <i>persistent wave effect</i>, all squares within radius&nbsp;R+1 of
  the original center take damage every 10&nbsp;game turns.
  <li>
  In a <i>directed wave effect</i>, only one "quadrant" of the wave takes
  damage, centered around one of the eight cardinal direction; for
  instance, if the wave is directed northeast, only squares between due
  north and due east of the original center take damage.
  </ul>
<li>
A <a name="storm"><i>storm effect</i></a> will be described with a radius,
a base damage, and a duration.  Initially, a <a href="#ball">ball
effect</a> is performed with the specified radius and base damage; every
10&nbsp;game turns after that for the specified duration, every square in
the player's line of sight at the specified distance from the player's
current position takes the specified base damage.
<li>
A <a name="wall"><i>wall effect</i></a> will be described with a duration
and a damage.  Initially, a beam effect is performed with the specified
damage; every 10&nbsp;game turns after that for the specified duration, the
specified damage is done at each square affected by the initial beam
effect, if it is currently in the player's line of sight.
<li>
A <a name="shield"><i>shield effect</i></a> will be described with a
duration, an optional damage, and an optional armor class change.  For the
duration of the spell, the player's armor class will be increased by the
specified amount, if any, and any monster that hits the player in melee
will receive the specified damage, if any.
<li>
A <a name="projection"><i>projection effect</i></a> will be specified with
a duration, a radius, and a base damage.  For the duration of the spell,
every time the player hits a monster with a weapon, a <a href="#ball">ball
effect</a> will be performed centered on the monster, with the specified
radius and base damage.  Barehand-combat and bearform-combat attacks do not
trigger projection effects.
</ul>
<h2><a name="schools">School spells</a></h2>
<p>
Spell schools can have the following annotations:
<ul>
<li>
<a name="sorcery">Spells in schools marked "SO"</a> can be cast with
Sorcery skill; the minimum required skill level and spell effect level are
computed using the larger of your school skill and your Sorcery skill.
<li>
<a name="spellpower">Spells in schools marked "SP"</a> receive a bonus to
spell effect level of (Sp&times;20)/50, rounded down to the nearest
integer, where Sp&nbsp;is your unrounded skill level in Spell-power.  For
multi-school spells, all schools must be so marked to receive the bonus.
<li>
<a name="prayer">Spells in schools marked</a> "&lt;<i>god-name</i>&gt;@M/N"
can be cast with Prayer skill if you worship the specified god; the minimum
required skill level and spell effect level are computed using the larger
of your school skill, the Sorcery skill (if so marked), and (Pr&times;M)/N
rounded down to the nearest integer, where Pr is your unrounded skill level
in Prayer.
</ul>
<p>
Spells are listed as "Spell Name (level A, mana B:C, fail D%)".  A&nbsp;is
the spell's level; your skill level in the school's skill (or Sorcery or
Prayer, as noted above) must be at least this high to cast the spell.
B&nbsp;and&nbsp;C denote a varying mana cost scaled by spell effect level;
the mana cost at spell effect level&nbsp;E is B+(E@(C-B)).  C&nbsp;will be
omitted if it is equal to&nbsp;B, in which case the spell has constant mana
cost.  D&nbsp;is the spell's base failure probability; this probability is
reduced by 3&times;(E-1)&nbsp;percent, and by 3&times;(F-1)&nbsp;percent,
where F&nbsp;is an adjustment amount based on the school's spell stat
(usually INT), as listed <a href="#statadj">below</a>.  The minimum fail
rate is also determined by the spell stat.
<p>
Some spells are multi-school; this will be noted in the spell annotation
described above as "School1+School2".  For multi-school spells, the minimum
required skill level and spell effect level are computed based on the
average of your skill levels in the coresponding school skills
(substituting Sorcery or Prayer where appropriate, as described above).
<p>
<a name="sticks">Some spells</a> are available via wands and staffs, as a
Wand/Staff of &lt;<i>spell-name</i>&gt;[M|N].  As detailed in the
Magic-Device section of <a href="skill-220.html#device">the skill
spoiler</a>, using such a wand or staff is equivalent to casting the spell
at spell effect level E=S+M-L+1, with a minimum of&nbsp;0 and a maximum
of&nbsp;N, where L&nbsp;is the spell's level and S&nbsp;is your skill level
in Magic-Device rounded down to the nearest integer; this is the number
displayed as "Spell level" in the description of the wand/staff via the
'<tt>I</tt>'nspect command.  Spells that are available via wands or staffs
will have the annotation "[M1-M2|N1-N2]", where&nbsp;M1 and&nbsp;M2 are the
minimum and maximum allowed values of&nbsp;M for the spell, and similarly
for&nbsp;N1 and&nbsp;N2.
<p>
As with effect durations, all spell durations are specified as multiples of
10&nbsp;game turns.
<dl>
<dt class="school"><a name="mana">Mana (SO,SP,Eru Iluvatar@1/2)</a></dt>
<dd>
  <dl>
  <dt>Manathrust (level 1, mana 1:25, fail 10%, [1-20|15-33])</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
Casts a targeted bolt of mana with damage (3+E)d(1+(E@20:1)).
  </dd>
  <dt>Remove Curses (level 10, mana 20:40, fail 30%, [1-5|15-50])</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
Uncurses all carried items.  If&nbsp;E&ge;20, also removes heavy curses, as
per a Scroll of *Remove Curse*.
  </dd>
  <dt>Elemental Shield (level 20, mana 17:20, fail 40%)</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
Confers temporary resistance to fire, cold, lightning and acid, each with a
separate duration of 15+E+1d10.
  </dd>
  <dt>Disruption Shield (level 45, mana 50, fail 90%)</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
If&nbsp;E&ge;5, the player will be near-invulnerable for the duration of
the spell, taking no damage from any attack or damaging effect with
probability 12&nbsp;in&nbsp;13.  If&nbsp;E&lt;5, for the duration of the
spell any damage taken by the player will lower mana instead of hit points
if the player has nonzero mana.  The duration of the spell is
3+(E@10:1)+1d5; the spell also terminates immediately if the player attacks
any monster, throws anything, casts any spell, or activates any
skill-based, racial or ability-based power.
  </dd>
  </dl>
</dd>
<dt class="school"><a name="geomancy">Geomancy (SP)</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>
Note that in addition to the usual skill level requirements for casting
Geomancy spells, you must also have a skill level of at least&nbsp;1 in the
Fire, Air, Earth and Water skills, and you must be wielding a Mage Staff.
Some Geomancy spells have a higher minimum skill level in one of the
subskills of Geomancy; this will be noted in the spell annotation as
"&lt;<i>skill-name</i>&gt;:N".
<p>
The effects of many Geomancy spells depend on your skill level in the
subskills of Geomancy.  We define a "scaled" skill level
(&lt;<i>skill-name</i>&gt;@N), analogous to the scaled spell effect level
notation, defined as (S&times;N)/50, rounded down to the nearest integer,
where S&nbsp;is your unrounded skill level in the named skill.  For
notational convenience, the notation (&lt;<i>skill-name</i>&gt;@50), which
works out to your skill level in the named skill rounded down to the
nearest integer, will be shortedned to (&lt;<i>skill-name</i>&gt;).
<p>
Some Geomancy effects are common to multiple spells:
<ul>
<li> A <a name="floorchange"><i>floor-change effect</i></a> changes an
affected square to a random floor type (hence the name).  The possible
floor types depend on your skill level in the subskills of Geomancy:
  <ul>
  <li> Sand, if (Fire)&ge;1.
  <li> Shallow lava, if (Fire)&ge;8.
  <li> Deep lava, if (Fire)&gt;18.
  <li> Shallow water, if (Water)&ge;1.
  <li> Deep water, if (Water)&ge;8.
  <li> Ice, if (Water)&ge;18.
  <li> Grass, if (Earth)&ge;1.
  <li> Grass with flowers, if (Earth)&ge;8.
  <li> Dark pit, if (Earth)&ge;18.
  </ul>
<p>
The resulting floor type is chosen as follows:  First, one of the above
possibilities is chosen, with equal probability.  If the skill level check
succeeds and a probability check of 2&times;S&nbsp;percent succeeds (where
S&nbsp;is your unrounded skill level in the corresponding skill), then that
floor type is used; otherwise, another floor type is chosen in the same
fashion until both checks succeed.
<li> A <a name="wallchange"><i>wall-change effect</i></a> changes an
affected square to a random wall type (hence the name).  The possible wall
types depend on your skill level in the subskills of Geomancy:
  <ul>
  <li> Sandwall, if (Fire)&ge;1.
  <li> Trees, if (Water)&ge;1.
  <li> Ice wall, if (Water)&ge;12.
  <li> Granite wall, if (Earth)&ge;1.
  </ul>
<p>
The resulting wall type is chosen in the same manner as for the
floor-change effect above.
</ul>
  <dl>
  <dt>Call the Elements (level 1, mana 2:10, fail 10%)</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
Fires a <a href="#ball">ball effect</a> of radius&nbsp;1+(E@5);
if&nbsp;E&ge;17, the ball can be targeted, otherwise it is centered on the
player.  A <a href="#floorchange">floor-change effect</a> is applied to all
floor squares in the affected area.  Can be cast while blind.
  </dd>
  <dt>Channel Elements (level 3, mana 3:30, fail 20%)</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
The effect of the spell depends on the terrain type at the player's location:
  <ul>
  <li> Grass:  Heals 5+(Earth@20)&nbsp;percent of the player's hit points.
  <li> Grass with flowers:  Heals 5+(Earth@30)&nbsp;percent of the player's
  hit points.
  <br><i>[The spell description says that these effects "may be projected
  to heal a companion or pet", but the code gives no indication of this.]</i>
  <li> Dark pit:  Fires a targeted bolt doing damage 10d(Earth).  The
  damage is of type nether if&nbsp;(Earth)&ge;18, dark otherwise.
  <li> Shallow water:  Fires a targeted bolt (if&nbsp;(Water)&lt;8) or beam
  (if&nbsp;(Water)&ge;8) doing damage 3d(Water).  The damage is of type
  water if&nbsp;(Water)&lt;18, otherwise it is of type "wave" (the target
  takes water damage and is pushed away from the player).
  <li> Deep water:  Same as shallow water, except that damage done is
  5d(Water).
  <li> Ice:  If&nbsp;(Water)&ge;12, fires a targeted
  <a href="#ball">ball</a> of ice with radius&nbsp;3 and base damage
  (Water@340); otherwise, fires a targeted bolt of ice doing damage
  3d(Water).
  <li> Sand:  Casts a <a href="#shield">shield effect</a> with duration
  E+1d20+(Air) and damage (5+(Fire@20))d(5+(Fire@14)).  The damage type
  depends on your spell effect level for the Fire spell Fiery Shield
  (denoted here Ef): unresistable if&nbsp;Ef&ge;15, fire if&nbsp;Ef&lt;15.
  Also inflicts blindness for the same duration.
  <li> Shallow lava:  Fires a targeted bolt doing damage (Fire@30)d15.  The
  damage is hellfire if&nbsp;(Fire)&ge;15, fire otherwise.
  <li> Deep lava:  fires a targeted <a href="#ball">ball effect</a> with
  radius&nbsp;3 and base damage (Fire@30)d15.  THe damage is hellfire
  if&nbsp;(Fire)&ge;15, fire otherwise.
  <li> No effect for other floor types.
  </ul>
  <p>
The player's square is converted to type floor (or to grass if it was
originally grass with flowers).  Can be cast while blind.
  </dd>
  <dt>Vaporize (level 4, Air:4, mana 3:30, fail 15%)</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
Casts a <a href="#cloud">cloud effect</a> centered on the player with
radius&nbsp;1+(E@4:1) and duration 10+(E@20:1).  The damage type and base
damage depend on the terrain type at the player's location:
  <ul>
  <li> Grass:  Damage type poison, base damage 5+(Earth@100).
  <li> Grass with flowers:  Damage type poison, base damage 5+(Earth@150).
  <li> Dark pit:  Damage type dark, base damage 5+(Earth@200).
  <li> Shallow water:  Damage type water, base damage 5+(Water@100).
  <li> Deep water:  Damage type water, base damage 5+(Water@150).
  <li> Ice:  Damage type water, base damage 5+(Water@100).
  <li> Sand:  Damage type light, base damage 5+(Fire@200).
  <li> Shallow lava:  Damage type fire (holy fire if&nbsp;E&ge;20), base
  damage 5+(Fire@100).
  <li> Deep lava:  Damage type fire (holy fire if&nbsp;E&ge;20), base
  damage 5+(Fire@150).
  <li> No effect for other floor types.
  </ul>
  <p>
The terrain at the player's location is converted to type floor.  Can be
cast while blind.
  </dd>
  <dt>Geolysis (level 7, Earth:7, mana 15:40, fail 15%)</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
Tunnels in the specified direction for distance 5+(E@12:1), starting at the
player's location and stopping if a non-tunnelable wall square is hit.  A
<a href="#floorchange">floor-change effect</a> is applied at each square
along the tunneling path; a <a href="#wallchange">wall-change effect</a> is
applied to all tunnelable wall squares adjacent to the tunneling path.  At
each square along the tunneling path, there is a 20% chance of a branch
forming; the branch will be one&nbsp;third the length of the original
tunneling path and angled 45&nbsp;degrees off the original path (equal
probability for either side), and is otherwise generated in the same manner
as the original path, including the possibility of further sub-branches.
Can be cast while blind.
  </dd>
  <dt>Dripping Tread (level 10, Water:10, mana 15:25, fail 15%)</dt>

<dt><a name="ccs">Charming, confusion, stunning, slowing</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>
These are effects that can be resisted by a monster with a probability
based on the monster's level and the power of the spell.  If a spell with
power&nbsp;P is cast on a level-M monster, then:
<ul>
<li>
The monster will resist a charm spell with probability
M-1&nbsp;in&nbsp;P-5.  If the spell only affects certain types of monsters,
like animals or demons, this probability reduces to M-1&nbsp;in&nbsp;P.
Note that uniques, quest monsters, and monsters that resist confusion
cannot be charmed by spells of this sort.
<li>
The monster will resist a confusion spell with probability
M-1&nbsp;in&nbsp;P;  if it does not resist, its confusion timer is set to
1+3d(P/2) if it is not already confused, or increased by half that amount
if it is already confused, to a maximum of 200 game turns.
<li>
The monster will resist a stun spell with probability M-1&nbsp;in&nbsp;P;
if it does not resist, its stun timer is set to 1+(L/10+3)dP if it is not
already stunned (where L&nbsp;is the player's experience level), or
increased by half that amount if it is already stunned, to a maximum of 200
game turns.
<li>
The monster will resist a slow spell with probability M-1&nbsp;in&nbsp;P;
if it does not resist, its speed is decreased by&nbsp;10.  Note that
uniques are immune to this effect.
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><a name="invis">Invisibility</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>
Unlike in some of its predecessors, invisibility in ToME is not a binary
effect; it has a power level, which determines how powerful a monster must
be to see through your invisibility.  This is computed as follows:  Let
I&nbsp;be your total invisibility power and M&nbsp;be the monster's level,
modified as follows:
<ul>
<li> M=M+10 if the monster is immune to sleep
<li> M=M+20 if the monster is a dragon
<li> M=M+15 if the monster is undead, a demon, or an animal
<li> M=M-15 if the monster is an orc
<li> M=M-10 if the monster is a troll
<li> M=M/2 if the monster is stupid
<li> M=(M*5)/4 rounded down if the monster is smart.
<li> I=0 if the monster is invisible, a quest monster, or under your
control
</ul>
<p>
Then the monster will be unable to see you with probability
I&nbsp;in&nbsp;M&times;2.
<p>
Invisibility power conferred by worn items are cumulative with each other
and with temporary invisibility power; temporary invisibility effects are
cumulative in time, using the power of the most recently activated
temporary effect.  For comparison, here are the power levels of common
sources of invisibility:
<ul>
<li>
Rings of Invisibility have power 40.
<li>
Artifacts and ego items that provide invisibility have power 10&nbsp;times
their pval.
<li>
An invisible symbiote confers invisibility power 20.
<li>
An invisible possessed body confers invisibility power 20.
<li>
Invisibility provided by Melkor for high piety has power 30.
<li>
Potions of Invisibility confers temporary invisibility of power 35.
<li>
The Invisibility Mimicry power confers temporary invisibility of power 50.
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><a name="mlevel">Leveled monsters</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>
Monsters in ToME can gain levels and become more powerful by killing
monsters to gain experience, much like the player does.  In some cases (the
Angband dungeon, some relic quests), monsters are artificially raised to a
higher level on creation; such a monster is described herein as "leveled to
monster level&nbsp;N".  Each time a monster gains a level, it may gain
any or all of the following modifications:
<ul>
<li> With proability&nbsp;80%, it gains one "die" of hit points and max hit
points.  For instance, a Kobold, whose normal hit points are 3d7, would
gain 7 hit points and 7 max hit points.
<li> With probability&nbsp;40%, it gains +1d2 speed.
<li> WIth probability&nbsp;50%, it gains +A/10 armor class (rounded down to
the nearest integer, with a minimum of 1), where A&nbsp;is the monster's
starting armor class.
<li> With probability&nbsp;30%, one of its first three melee attacks is
increased by one "die".  For instance, a Kobold's 1d8 attack would increase
to 2d8.
</ul>
<p>
For a "leveled" monster, these effects are applied once for each difference
in level between the monster's default level and the target level (if the
latter is less than the former, no change is made).  This can produce some
truly horrific monsters:  a Kobold (default monster level&nbsp;2) leveled
to monster level&nbsp;50, for instance, will on average have 3d7+268 hit
points, +29 speed, armor class 40 and a 15d8 melee attack.
