<h1>The (Not Yet) Comprehensive ToME 2.2.x Skill Spoiler</h1>
<p><i><small>[Last modified 2005-01-09.  See
<a href="#changelog">below</a> for recent changes.]</small></i>
<p>
It's a common dilemma among ToME players:  which skills to raise?  Well,
that depends on the answer to the next question:  What benefits am I
getting from these skills?  For some skills, like Magic, the effect of a
skill increase is immediate and obvious (more mana, in this case), but some
skills don't have obvious effects, leading one to wonder whether
increasing, say, one's Weaponmastery skill is actually buying one anything.
<p>
This spoiler is an attempt to answer those questions.  I've examined the
source (specifically, the 2.2.0 thru 2.2.7 release versions) looking for
everywhere a skill level is used, and I describe here the specific,
quantitative effects that different skills have on gameplay.
<p>
<i>[<strong>NOTE:</strong>  This spoiler is (intended to be) correct for
ToME v2.2.0 thru v2.2.7.  There have been some changes since the previous
version, v2.1.2; for information on that version, see the
<a href="skill.html">2.1.2 version</a> of this spoiler.  For later
versions of ToME, see the <a href="skill-230.html">2.3.x version</a> of
this spoiler.</i>

<h2><a name="notation">Notation</a></h2>
<p>
For notational convenience, we will use the following conventions herein:
<ul>
<li> A&times;B denotes multiplication; for instance 5&times;6 evaluates
to&nbsp;30.
<li> A/B denotes division, rounded down to the nearest integer.
For instance, 9.2/5 evaluates to&nbsp;1.  [Note that rounding happens
<em>before</em> combining with other expressions; thus, 15/10+15/10
evaluates to&nbsp;2, not&nbsp;3.  Note also that this rounding applies to
<em>all</em> division operations in all the formulas herein (with the
exception of those using the notation below).]
<li> A//B represents "fixed-point" division.  Typically the result is
something like a percentage (represented internally as an integer from 0
to&nbsp;100) or a weight (represented internally in tenths of a pound), so
that the result of the division is effectively retained to one or two
decimal places.
<li> A^B denotes exponentiation, or A to the B'th power.  For instance,
3^4=3&times;3&times;3&times;3=81.
<li> NdM is the standard "dice" notation; for instance, 3d6 denotes the sum
of three independent uniformly distributed random integers from&nbsp;1
to&nbsp;6, or three six-sided dice.  For more complicated forms, we will
use parentheses, as in (A&times;B)d(C+D/2).
<li> S is your skill level in the skill under discussion, rounded down to
the nearest integer.
<li> (S@N) represents a "scaled" skill level, with the usual 0-to-50 skill
range scaled linearly to 0-to-N.  Specifically, it is defined as
(sk&times;N)/50, where 'sk' is the un-rounded skill level.  For instance,
if your skill level in the skill under discussion is 2.900, then (S@100)
evaluates to&nbsp;290.0/50, which rounds down to&nbsp;5.
</ul>
<h2><a name="skill_abil">Skills vs. Abilities</a></h2>
<p>
As a result of ToME's Angband heritage, ToME characters have other
skill-like properties that are not directly adjusted on the skill selection
screen.  These are listed on the '<tt>C</tt>'haracter screen as
"<tt>(Miscellaneous Abilities)</tt>", and include things like Fighting,
Perception, and Saving Throw.  [These are distinct, by the way, from the
abilities listed on the "<tt>ToME Abilities Screen</tt>" under the
'<tt>N</tt>' command --- an unfortunate naming collision.]  The base level
of an ability is determined by your race, sub-race and class, and does not
increase with level; some of them, however, increase along with the
corresponding skill.
<p>
<a name="classmod">The amount</a> by which a skill affects an ability
depends on class, and is referred to as the "class modifier" for the
ability, hereinafter denoted CM.  The class modifiers for different
abilities and classes are listed <a href="#classmod-tbl">below</a>.
Typically, an ability will be increased by your scaled skill level in the
corresponding skill, where the scale factor will be some multiple of the
class modifier.
<h2><a name="skills">The skills</a></h2>
<p>
Some skills have additional annotations, as follows:
<ul>
<li> Skills marked with "(FF)" can be gained or improved by a
Fumblefingers/Lost-Sword quest.
<li> Skills marked with "(NG)" are "no-gloves" magical skills; if any of
these skills is 1 or higher, wearing gloves or gauntlets will reduce your
maximum mana to 75% of its normal value, unless the gloves provide free
action, increase your DEX, or can contain a spell.
</ul>
<dl>
<dt><a name="combat">Combat (FF)</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>
The Combat skill has the following effects:
<ul>
<li> You receive a damage bonus of +S/5 for melee and ranged attacks.
<li> Your <a href="#abil_fight">Fighting</a> and
<a href="#abil_bow">Bows/Throw</a> abilities are increased by
(<a href="#classmod">CM</a>&times;3&times;S)/100.
<li> The total weight in pounds of armor (body armor, helm, gloves, boots,
shield and cloak) that you can wear without being burdened and reducing
mana is S+20; your maximum mana is reduced by&nbsp;1 for every full pound
you exceed this maximum.
<li> A given "combat" item (weapons, armor, ammo, trap kits and Demonology
paraphernalia) in your inventory or equipment will pseudo-ID on a given
turn with probability 1&nbsp;in&nbsp;9000/(S&times;S+40); if S&ge;11, the
pseudo-ID will be "heavy" (<tt>{average}</tt> detection, distinguishing
<tt>{good}</tt> from <tt>{excellent}</tt>, and so forth).
<li> <a name="combat_pierce">A piercing shot</a> (see
<a href="#archery_pierce">Archery</a> and
<a href="#archery_sub_pierce">subskills</a> below) can pass through at most
S/10-1 monsters, with a minimum of zero (obviously).
<li> A confusion attack (that is, a melee attack after reading a Scroll of
Monster Confusion, or as a possible chaotic effect of hitting with a
Chaotic weapon) will confuse the monster for 10+R/5 turns, or increase its
current confusion duration by that amount, where R&nbsp;is 1dS-1.
<li> After completing the Thieves quest, the next quest offered at the Bree
Mayor's office will be the Troll quest with probability 95% if your Combat
skill is higher than your Magic skill, 5% if it is lower, and 50% if they
are equal; otherwise, it will be the Wight quest.
</ul>
<p>
<a name="melee_style"><b>Melee styles:</b></a>  Some subskills of Combat
correspond to melee styles:
<ul>
<li> Weaponmastery &rarr; Weapon combat
<li> Barehand-combat &rarr; Barehanded combat
<li> Bearform-combat &rarr; Bearform combat
<p>
In order to use a melee style, its corresponding skill must be at
least&nbsp;1.  If only one melee style is available based on your skill
levels, you will use it automatically; if more than one are available, you
can choose between them via the "<tt>Change melee style</tt>" command under
the '<tt>m</tt>' menu (if none are available, "Weapon combat" is the
default).  The effects of a melee style are based on your skill level in
the corresponding skill:
<ul>
<li>
Your <a href="#abil_fight">Fighting</a> ability is increased by
(<a href="#classmod">CM</a>&times;7&times;S)/100.
<li>
<a name="crit_prob">The probability</a> of scoring a critical hit with a
melee attack is W+5&times;(H+Z)+C&times;50+(S@150)&nbsp;in&nbsp;5000, where
W&nbsp;is the weight of the weapon in tenths of a pound (or S&times;1d10
for non-weapon combat), H&nbsp;is your total to-hit bonus from all sources,
Z&nbsp;is an adjustment based on the attack type (Z=H for weapon combat),
and C&nbsp;is the bonus from a Ring of Critical Hits or similar items.  This
is potentially further modified by the

For notational convenience, we will use the technically ungrammatical
singular "an ammo" in the following to refer to a single launched arrow,
bolt or shot.
  <ul>
  <li> Your <a href="#abil_bow">Bows/Throw</a> ability is increased by
  (<a href="#classmod">CM</a>&times;7&times;S)/100.
  <li> Your probability of scoring a critical hit with a ranged attack is
  increased by (S@100)//50&nbsp;percent.
  <li> The probability of an ammo breaking when thrown at a monster,
  normally 50&nbsp;percent for arrows and 25&nbsp;percent for shots and
  bolts, is divided by (S@10), rounded down to the nearest percent; thus,
  at skill level 50, arrows break with probability 5&nbsp;percent, and
  bolts break with probability 2&nbsp;percent.  This does not apply to
  boomerangs, which have a constant 1-percent breakage chance.
  <li> <a name="archery_pierce" href="#archery_sub_pierce">A piercing
  shot</a> will pass through a hit monster with probability
  S+45&nbsp;percent, unless it has already done so the maximum number of
  times, as determined by the Combat skill <a href="#combat_pierce">above</a>.
  <li> If you have the <tt>Ammo creation</tt> ability, the types of ammo
  that can be forged via the "<tt>Forge ammo</tt>" command under the
  '<tt>m</tt>' menu depend on&nbsp;S:
    <ul>
    <li> If S&ge;1, you can forge shots from rubble.  [We will describe the
    process for doing so here, since it is different from that of forging
    shots and bolts, and this difference has apparently confused many
    people (including, at one time, the author): First stand next to the
    pile of rubble; then select the "<tt>Forge ammo</tt>" skill under the
    '<tt>m</tt>' menu , select "<tt>[S]hots</tt>", and indicate the
    direction to the pile of rubble when prompted.]
    <li> If S&ge;10, you can forge arrows out of junk in your inventory or
    at your feet ("junk" here means things like Broken sticks and Elf
    skeletons -- but not skeletons dropped by killed monsters).
    <li> If S&ge;20, you can forge bolts out of junk in your inventory or
    at your feet.

    <li> Vampirism fires S/15+P/2+1 bolt effects in the specified

  A temporary artifact will revert after S&times;S&times;3 turns.
  <li>
  When extracting essences from an item, you will lose some of the essences
  with probability 52-S&nbsp;in&nbsp;156.  This probability is checked
  separately for each type of essence in the item's recipe; the usual
  number of extracted essences, N, is reduced to either N/2 or N/3, with
  equal probability.
  <li>
  The explosion from an alchemy failure does 3d(L-S) damage, where
  L&nbsp;is the object's level plus the level of the ego type, if any.
  <li>
  If you learn an item's recipe while extracting its essences (this happens

  <dt><a name="mimicry">Mimicry (FF)</a></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
The Mimicry skill has the following effects:
  <ul>
  <li> When using a Mimicry cloak (Mouse Fur, Feathers Cloak, and the
  like), the failure rate is reduced by (S@150)&nbsp;percent (subject to a
  minimum of 2&nbsp;percent), and the duration is increased
  by&nbsp;(S@1000)&nbsp;turns.
  <li> When using other mimic powers, the failure probability is decreased
  by (S-L)&times;3&nbsp;percent, where L&nbsp;is the "spell level" of the
  power (subject to a DEX-based minimum fail rate; see
  <a href="#statadj">below</a>), and the duration is
  50+1d(50+S&times;2)&nbsp;turns (except for Invisibility, for which the
  duration is 10+S+1d20+P, where P&nbsp;is the spell-power boost conferred
  by a Mage Staff or Power or similar equipment).
  <li> The probability of resisting an abomination attack is increased by
  S&nbsp;percent.
  </ul>
  <p>
The effects of using a Mimicry cloak are also modified by Mimicry skill, as
follows:
  <ul>
  <li> Mouse Fur (mouse):
    <ul>
    <li> +5+(S/7) speed

<h2><a name="abil_eff">Ability effects</a></h2>
<p>
Specifying how much a skill level affects an ability level, of course, just
pushes the question back another stage:  what effect, then, does the
ability have?  Here we attempt to quantitatively describe some of these
effects.  We denote by&nbsp;A the ability level of the ability in question.
<dl>
<dt><a name="abil_fight">Fighting</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>
A melee attack on a monster will miss with probability
(C&times;3)/4&nbsp;in&nbsp;A+3&times;H+L, where C&nbsp;is the monster's armor
class, L&nbsp;is a luck-based modifier in the range -10&le;L&le;10,
and H&nbsp;is your total to-hit bonus from your weapon, STR, DEX,
skill-based sources and your current mimic form, if any (this amount is
displayed on the character screen as '<tt>+&nbsp;To Melee&nbsp;Hit</tt>');
thus, the Fighting ability roughly acts as a +A//3 to-hit for melee attacks.
<p>
[NB:  Actually, you will automatically hit with 5% probability and
automatically miss with 5% probability; the above probability is applied
the other 90% of the time.  Also, if you cannot see the monster you are
attacking, the probability is modified to
(C&times;3)/4&nbsp;in&nbsp;L+(A+3&times;H+1)/2.]
</dd>
<dt><a name="abil_bow">Bows/Throw</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>
A ranged attack on a monster will miss with probability
(C&times;3)/4&nbsp;in&nbsp;A+3&times;H-D+L, where C&nbsp;is the monster's
armor class, L&nbsp;is a luck-based modifier in the range -10&le;L&le;10,
D&nbsp;is the distance to the monster,
and H&nbsp;is your total to-hit bonus from your launcher, ammo, STR, DEX,
skill-based sources and your current mimic form, if any (this amount is
displayed on the character screen as '<tt>+&nbsp;To Ranged&nbsp;Hit</tt>');
thus, the Bows/Throw ability roughly acts as a +A//3 to-hit for ranged
attacks.  Note that this ability is only applied when shooting ammo from a
sling, bow or crossbow, and does not affect the use of boomerangs,
boulders, or other thrown objects.
<p>
[NB:  Actually, you will automatically hit with 5% probability and
automatically miss with 5% probability; the above probability is applied
the other 90% of the time.  Also, if you cannot see the monster you are
attacking, the probability is modified to
(C&times;3)/4&nbsp;in&nbsp;L+(A+3&times;H-D+1)/2.]
</dd>
<dt><a name="abil_sav">Saving Throw</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>
With probability A&nbsp;percent, you will successfully avoid the following
effects:
<ul>
<li> Fear from a terrify attack.
<li> Paralysis from a paralyze attack or spell or a <tt>TY_CURSE</tt>
("ancient foul curse") or <tt>DG_CURSE</tt> ("ancient Morgothian curse")
effect.
<li> Effects of a blindness, confusion, slow, teleport level or mind-blank
spell.
<li> Damage and equipment cursing from a cause-wounds spell or the Hand of
Doom spell.
<li> Teleport-level or stat-scrambling affects from a nexus attack.
<li> Effects of a mind-blast or brain-smash attack.  If you fail your
initial save on a brain-smash attack, you will get additional chances to
avoid the resulting INT and WIS loss (though not the other effects).
<li> Backlash effects from a failed Mindcraft attack on a high-level demon
or undead.
<li> The abomination effect of failure when using a Mimicry cloak.
</ul>
<p>
You will also resist sanity blasts from eldritch horror (CthAngband)
monsters with probability A&nbsp;in&nbsp;M+10, where M&nbsp;is the
monster's level.  Failing this, you will get additional chances to save
against the individual effects of the sanity blast.
<p>
Note that A&nbsp;is increased to a minimum of&nbsp;95 if you are wearing an
Amulet of Anti-Magic or other item which produces an anti-magic shell (as
distinct from the antimagic field generated by Dark Swords).
</dd>
<dt><a name="abil_stl">Stealth</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>
A sleeping monster will become "less sleepy" (that is, wake up or come
closer to waking up) in a given turn with probability
1&nbsp;in&nbsp;2^(A//3).  Note that the maximum allowed value of the
Stealth ability is&nbsp;30.
</dd>
<dt><a name="abil_perc">Perception</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>
You will automatically search adjacent squares on a given turn with
probability 1&nbsp;in&nbsp;50-A, or every turn if A&ge;50.
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><a name="abil_srch">Searching</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>
You have an A&nbsp;percent chance per turn spent searching to find an
adjacent secret door, trap or trapped chest (separate check for each).
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><a name="abil_dis">Disarming</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>
In each turn spent attempting to pick the lock of a door or chest or disarm
a trap or trapped chest, you will succeed with probability
A-X&nbsp;percent, with a mininum of 2&nbsp;percent, where X&nbsp;is an
adjustment based on the difficulty of the lock/trap.
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><a name="abil_dev">Magic Device</a></dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li> When inscribing on the floor, you will fail to detect the grid's mana
with probability 3&nbsp;in&nbsp;A-(M/10), where M&nbsp;is the grid's mana.
<li> You will fail when zapping a rod or activating an activateable object
with probability 2&nbsp;in&nbsp;A-L, where L&nbsp;is the object's level (to
a maximum of&nbsp;50 or&nbsp;A-1, whichever is less).  If&nbsp;A-L&le;2,
you will succeed with probability 1&nbsp;in&nbsp;(4-A+L)&times;3.  For
bjects with the <tt>EASY_USE</tt> flag (mostly Rods of Simplicity),
A-L is multiplied by&nbsp;10.
