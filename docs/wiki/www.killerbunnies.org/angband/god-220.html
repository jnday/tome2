<h1>The (Not Yet) Comprehensive ToME 2.2.x/2.3.x God Spoiler</h1>
<p><i><small>[Last modified 2005-02-28.  See
<a href="#changelog">below</a> for recent changes.]</small></i>
<p>
This spoiler attempts to describe and quantify the various in-game effects
of worshipping ToME's gods -- the benefits and penalties, how to gain (or
lose) piety, and so forth.  Note that the spells (and access to other spell
realms) provided by these gods is not listed here; see
<a href="spell-230.html">the ToME spell spoiler</a> for that information.

<h2><a name="info">Entry information</a></h2>
<p>
The entries below for each god contain information under the following
headings:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Normal piety change:</b>  Depending on what you're doing, your piety
will increase or decrease with time; this heading details the rate of this
change and what, if anything, you can do to alter it.
<li>
<b>Affecting piety:</b>  Depending on your god, certain actions will
increase or decrease your piety.
<li>
<b>Piety effects:</b>  At certain piety levels you will gain various
bonuses or penalties.  For some of these, you must be praying for the bonus
to take effect.
<li>
<b>Relic quests:</b>  The properties of the "temple" dungeons in which you
will occasionally go searching for lost relic pieces.  Includes:
  <ul>
  <li>
  General layout properties, including floor types, "fill" types (the
  impassable areas between rooms) and outer/inner wall types used to
  generate rooms.  Also noted is whether the dungeon is "ascending" (levels
  are shown as "<tt>LTm&nbsp;-5</tt>") or has "flat" levels" (up/down
  stairs are always at the edges and described as "paths to the
  next/previous area", like Mirkwood and the Barrow Downs) or "empty"
  levels (entire level is open space, with rooms interspersed, like Rhun).
  <li>
  Monster leveling relative to dungeon level, minimum number of monsters
  generated during level creation, and monster generation rate, expressed
  as the probability of a new monster being generated every 10 game turns
  (equal to one player turn at normal speed).  Note that the first level of
  all temple dungeons will be level&nbsp;(L&times;2)/3, rounded down, where
  L&nbsp;is your level when you receive the quest.
  <li>
  Distribution of monster properties.  This will be given as a list of
  "rules" with a probability distribution:  some percent of monsters will
  have a certain set of properties, some percent will have another set, and
  so forth.  If the listed percentages do not add up to&nbsp;100%, then no
  restrictions are placed on the remaining fraction of monsters.
  <li>
  Distribution of types of objects found on floor or generated by chests or
  Scrolls of Acquirement, grouped as "treasure" (chests, crowns, rings,
  amulets, dragon armor), "combat" (weapons and armor, excluding those
  listed in other groups), "magic" (potions, scrolls, wands, staffs, rods,
  rod tips, parchments, runes, essences, junkarts, spellbooks, Mage Staffs
  and Demonology gear), and "tools" (light sources, cloaks, boots, spikes,
  diggers, food, flasks of oil, musical instruments, trapkits, iron spikes,
  and tools that can be wielded in the digger slot).  If the listed
  percentages do not add up to&nbsp;100%, the rest is allocated to "junk"
  (skeletons, empty bottles, eggs, and other junk items).
  </ul>
<li>
<b>Other effects:</b>  Anything else that is affected by worshipping a
particular god.
</ul>
<h2><a name="notation">Notation</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
P&nbsp;denotes your current piety (displayed as "<tt>Pt</tt>" on the main
screen).
<li>
(W@N) denotes "scaled" WIS, and is defined as (I&times;N)/37 rounded down
to the nearest integer, where I&nbsp;is the stat index of your&nbsp;WIS --
which in turn is defined as your displayed WIS minus three (if you have
turned off the "<tt>Stats are represented in a linear way</tt>" option,
then for WIS values of <tt>18/NNN</tt> the stat index is 15+NNN/10, to a
maximum of&nbsp;37 at&nbsp;<tt>18/***</tt>).
<li>
Piety change rates are listed in game turns; 10 game turns is equivalent to
one player turn at normal speed.
<li>
When discussing a monster or an attack on (or by) a monster, M&nbsp;will
denote the level of the monster under discussion.

  <a href="spell-230.html#melkor_curse">Curse</a> may be applied to the

  Worshipping Melkor gains you access to the

  <li>
  As a Melkor worshipper, you can sacrifice corpses and spellbooks on
  Melkor's altars (described as "Altars of Darkness" in-game) to gain piety.
  Sacrificing a corpse increases your piety by&nbsp;M&times;2; sacrificing a
  spellbook increases your piety by&nbsp;L&times;2, where L&nbsp;is the sum
  of the spell levels of all the spells in the book.  Note that spellbooks
  that contain any Udun spells cannot be sacrificed.
  <li>
  You can also sacrifice hit points directly; each such sacrifice decreases
  your maximum hit points by&nbsp;10 and, at your option, either increases
  your piety by&nbsp;300&times;(W@6) or increases your melee damage
  by&nbsp;(W@4), with a minimum of&nbsp;1.  (Note that this bonus is
  recomputed retroactively as your WIS changes; that is, your current
  damage bonus from hit-point sacrifice equals your current&nbsp;(W@4)
  times the total number of times you've sacrificed hit points for damage
  bonus).
