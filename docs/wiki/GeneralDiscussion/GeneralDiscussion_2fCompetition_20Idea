Idea 1: Any options/character/race you want, your character cannot use any kind of identification methods. okay okay better one.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 Idea 2:<br>
 The cursed...<br>
 Your character can only wear/wield cursed items.  Excluding starting equipment.<br>
 <p>
<strong><a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a></strong>: I don't see how either of those could possibly work, to be honest, though I'm glad to see the interest. (I already know what I want to do for the next unofficial comp.... and it's much nastier than the first.... &lt;bg&gt;) 
</p>

    <ul>

 <strong><a href="./BurbLulls">BurbLulls</a></strong>: Does the first idea include not selling things, as that IDs them? Maybe there could be a competition where the character completely ignores money/shops. 
    </ul>


<p>
<a href="./MassimilianoMarangio">MassimilianoMarangio</a>: Another idea:<br>
 Idea 3: Artifactless characters. You can only use normal or ego items, but no artifacts, random artifacts, junkarts, unique corpses. 
</p>

    <ul>

 <strong><a href="./ZasVid">ZasVid</a></strong>: Can you sell artifacts? <p>
 <a href="./MassimilianoMarangio">MassimilianoMarangio</a>: I think yes (or collect artifacts in the Mathom House) 
</p>
<p>
 <strong><a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a></strong>: Sure, you can sell artifacts. I do it all the time. 
</p>
<p>
 <strong><a href="./ElIott">ElIott</a></strong>:  This one might not only be doable, but actually fun with just a little more flexibility.  How about something like normal, magic, and ego items are all fine, as are all randart weapons (but not truearts) and all trueart armor (but no randarts and no Trone's armor).  IMO, endgame equipment is a tad predictable.  90+% of characters going after Morgoth have either Elessar or the Toris for their amulet and the Arkenstone for their light source, Trone's or randart armor, and, depending on class, one of about 5 different weapons.  There's plenty of good enough equipment this way, but you won't have all the swordmasters carrying one of the sentient weapons or Ringil, and the trueart armors really aren't all that great.  Someone might actually go get Razorback because its useful rather than just for the challenge. 
</p>
<p>
 <strong><a href="./ZasVid">ZasVid</a></strong>: I'd rather go for all-ego. Randarts happen to be very powerful in every department and trueart armor makes every other piece of body armor redundant (except for dragon scales). Besides this, newbies could sometimes be confused whether the yellow-lettered item they'd found was allowed in competition. Anyway, this would be an interesting challenge to take (esp. with hard-to-come-by immunities). However, I think that it shouldn't be started it while Randomcomp1 is still running. 
</p>
<p>
 <strong><a href="./ElIott">ElIott</a></strong>: Good point about the confusion, though you're right in that covering some of those higher resists would just be brutal.  Boots of stablity would actually be useful for a change, and dragon shields of preservation woulld be the 'must have' defensive items.  Mages and archers would see their offense almost unchanges, while melee characters would be pretty badly nerfed.  Hardcore weapon-using melee characters would have a seriously hard time killing Nazgul.  Sounds like fun.  
</p>

    </ul>


<p>
<strong><a href="./ChrisAmes">ChrisAmes</a></strong>: Or better yet, idea 4: You can only use artifacts. That would make an evil early game. Optionally no randarts either. 
</p>

    <ul>

 <a href="./FeathinSilyar">FeathinSilyar</a>:  Heheh, "evil", or "impossible"?  All warriors except for barehanded ones would be shot, and have to begin with magic device, mages and such wouldn't have too many problems.  Hm, it would be interesting.  Resistances sure would be a pain, with not being able to use most rings or defenders or elven items. 
        <ul>

  <strong><a href="./ChrisAmes">ChrisAmes</a></strong>: Only evil. Impssible is trying to win that game without spending a single skill point, winning the game possessing Smeagol (evil ending of course) or being a true pacafist (killing no monsters or uniques except for those *needed* (ie. Morgoth etc.) 
        </ul>


 <strong><a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a></strong>: Impossible, I'd say. Or at least very, very difficult for a non-cheating character. IMHO, all the suggestions I've seen so far on this page might do for a "Master Challenges" page, but they are extremely unfair for a newcomer to ToME. It's supposed to be fun, after all. <p>
 <strong><a href="./ElIott">ElIott</a></strong>:  Archers would simply be unplayable as there are only 3 or 4 trueart shots for bows and crossbows each, and only 1 trueart pebble.  I guess you could scum until you made some randart ammo, but that would just be hideous. 
</p>
<p>
 <strong><a href="./ZasVid">ZasVid</a></strong>: I suppose it wouldn't include using only artifact scrolls, potions, spellbooks and food? :P 
</p>

        <ul>

  <strong><a href="./ChrisAmes">ChrisAmes</a></strong>: Uh yeah that should have been you may only <em>equipt</em> artifacts. Whoops 
        </ul>


 <strong><a href="./ElIott">ElIott</a></strong>: Well, there is technically artifact food (Greater Ration of Health), but there's only one and I've never found it, so most characters would starve.  An artifact spellbook is much easier to come by, but completing the old mage's quest without any spells would be somewhat challenging. <p>
 <a href="./MassimilianoMarangio">MassimilianoMarangio</a>: Well, there are uniques and they leave (artifact-like) corpses that can be eaten. 
</p>

    </ul>


<p>
<strong><a href="./BurbLulls">BurbLulls</a></strong>: This could be a compo idea, but it'd be very hard to enforce as anyone could choose to ignore it. Have it so that they never have their inventory more than half full. Or perhaps a contest with warriors where you have to be constantly a coward, or mages with berserk. 
</p>

    <ul>

 <strong><a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a></strong>: If you have autopickup turned on, sticking to half-full inventory is impossible. Plus, it's hard enough to play with a full inventory! And the other two... sorry, but I just don't see the point. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15"> (Still keeping my idea for next RANDOMCOMP under wraps. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile4.png" alt=";-)" height="15" width="15"> ) <p>
 <strong><a href="./BurbLulls">BurbLulls</a></strong>: True, true. I never use autopickup, so I wouldn't know. Has anyone suggested the idea about ignoring money/stores? I put it up higher in this page, but I doubt it was read hidden up there. 
</p>
<p>
 <strong><a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a></strong>: Well, I just looked at it, and I have to say that it seems a little silly to me. (Sorry!) Sure, you can set all sorts of stringencies on a character generation, but at some point it becomes more about ego than fun. I'd just as soon keep the game fun. If you can win with such a non-cheating character, by all means please take bragging rights. But IMHO, it's not very enjoyable for a competition, at least for the average player. 
</p>
<p>
 <strong><a href="./BurbLulls">BurbLulls</a></strong>: Hmm... <em>&lt;paces&gt;</em> I've figured that any competition guidelines that aren't in birth options or character creation will not be fun, as the player will have to actively enforce them. Alright, round 4; instead of randomising your class and race like Maylith's compotition, randomly toggle all the birth options and deal with it through the game as best you can! Could be paired with randomising class and race. 
</p>

    </ul>


<p>
<strong><a class="nonexistent" href="./PhineasButterfat">PhineasButterfat</a></strong>: Two competition ideas: the winner is the one who wins with the least total damage taken during his lifetime (for everyone, maybe excluding summoners), or the winner is the one who wins having spent the least amount of mana during his lifetime (for mages). 
</p>

    <ul>

 <strong><a href="./ZasVid">ZasVid</a></strong>: Interesting. This would require writing a script to count and display total damage taken/mana spent, but I think it ain't too complicated. </ul>
