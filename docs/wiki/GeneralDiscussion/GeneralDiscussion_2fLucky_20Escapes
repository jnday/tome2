<strong><a href="./RogerBarnett">RogerBarnett</a></strong> Care to give us all a description of your <strong>absolute luckiest of lucky escapes</strong>, when you should have died but for some reason, the RNG smiled upon you? Mine is a simple tale, of a misplaced trap... <p>
I (<em>still!</em>) have a character who was lucky enough to find Ringil, my first and only find of it ever. I've also been carrying around Mormegil to level it up, and when I want to deal some heavy damage - obviously not leaving Mormegil on due to the exp drain and more importantly, the HP drain. Mormegil is currently on level 32 - it's got some great + bonuses, but still hasn't accessed any realm other than Fire, which is annoying. I'm hoping that it gains the Slay Evil or Slay Demon brand from Lightning/Cold realm - then it'll be my new uberweapon... 
</p>
<p>
You can imagine how annoyed I was when I was clearing a lesser vault and managed to set off a couple of traps... no big deal - I finished clearing the vault, and decided to rest as I was on about 40% of my hit points. Errr, my HP aren't recovering? Uh-oh. Trap of silent switching. I'm wielding Mormegil. And it's now heavily cursed! 
</p>
<p>
And this *had* to happen when I was on level 40 of Moria. Making my way out after visiting Khazad-dum, so I couldn't recall to the surface, only back to to Khazad-dum. I recalled to Khazad-dum to check, as a matter of emergency, for *Remove Curse* scrolls, and found none. went back. Worked my way up through the dungeon levels, drinking every healing potion I had en route, grabbing every healing potion I got from a monster and drinking it, and mapping and detecting at every point to find the shortest route to the surface. Slammed with stat drain from the Topi Ylinen curse on the sword twice. Made it back to the surface... trekked across to Bree. Got next to my house (where I'd stashed a potion of *healing* earlier), with 31HP. Yes, 31 HP. Drank it, and was able to then walk across to the Temple, where THANK ERU they had a scroll of *remove curse*. 
</p>
<p>
That was too close. And all because of a little tiny trap that's usually just annoying. Ladies and gentlemen, the moral of the story is obvious... whether or not you plan to wield a self-cursing weapon, *always* carry curse removal around with you. You never know when it may save your life. Apologies for length, but I just had to share that one. It's amazing how much hell that little trap caused me! I had to ignore a greater vault en route to the surface just to get there in time to live <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/sad.png" alt=":(" height="15" width="15">

<a href="./NerdanelVampire">NerdanelVampire</a>: It was in my early days of playing ToME and my unbeliever had due to her stupidity in charging headlong (leaning on an arrow key) gotten surrounded by about a dozen orcs in the middle of a room in Mirkwood. I had very little healing (the few remaining mushrooms from Farmer Maggot), no teleportation scrolls, and no means to damage the orcs quickly enough to matter. I would be dead in something like three turns. Then random teleportation from my almost-completely-good randart ring kicked in, and since it was uncursed at the time, asked politely if I wished to teleport. YES, I DID! I ended up in a safe part of the level and survived. 
</p>
<p>
She died soon after anyway. Luck cannot override that much incompetence.

<a href="./ElIott">ElIott</a>:  I had a similar character to <a href="./NerdanelVampire">NerdanelVampire</a>.  A high-elven rogue entry in the JOAT unofficial competition, who had collected a bunch of the corruptions in an attempt to get Demonology.  Late in Mordor, he entered a very small level with a bunch of stuff sitting on the ground under a horde of monsters.  The stuff looked really interesting, so  JOAT Mass Geno'ed them away and started checking things out.  Uriel was there, but by the end of Mordor, my characters pretty much all have <a class="nonexistent" href="./ImFire">ImFire</a>, which makes Uriel pretty easy, plus Uriel was asleep and JOAT had great stealth. 
</p>
<p>
About half-way through, Uriel wakes up and promptly breathes fire, which, I had forgotten, JOAT is NOT immune to.  Oops.  JOAT is down to about 50 hp, is about 10 steps to the nearest staircase, and while he's faster than Uriel, the entire level is one mid-sized room, so there's nowhere to hide or teleport away to.  Oh, and only CCW potions left for healing. 
</p>
<p>
After thinking on it overnight, I decided to run for the stairs.  After one step, the random teleport corruption kicked in, teleporting him right to the stairs!  Uriel wasted his shot by taking a step forward.  JOAT then was lucky enough to get a double move and he ran to the stairs and up them.  Whew.  Thank you RNG.

<a href="./DanielJoo">DanielJoo</a>: I had a wicked lucky escape yesterday as well, playing my best tome character <a class="external" href="./angband.oook.cz/ladder-show.php?id=3244"><img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">Skandar Graun</a> the orc swordmaster. Skandar happens to possess Sting, which has gained the earthquake flag like good sentient weapons usually do (okay I know this is not the RNG-bashing topic). I guess most people would just set it aside at that point (even Lord Dimwit suggests it in his awe-inspiring guide that one should never use such weapon). Anyhow, I like that blade so much, I couldnt just let it go, so i decided to keep it around anyhow levelling it when i have a good chance. So I had this pair of swords heading into Mountain Doom which was a very good place for me to gather a false sense of confidence. Until 98 I cut through everything, including awesome uniques like nobody's business, coming to the conclusion that i am pretty awesome myself and also somewhat invincible. With that in my dumb head I headed into the special level (for the first time ever and without reading the spoiler about it...) and...charged. Now charging is something you DO NOT do in <a class="nonexistent" href="./MtDoom">MtDoom</a>. Hack...not ever. Of course I got surrounded in no time by every bad thing you can imagine. Greater Undead and Balrogs and all. Ok...I was like "lets quaff *healing* and mass banish". Ooops. that aint working on special levels. Well than..."how about one more healing and teleport away"? No that aint gonna happen either. For a second I was thinking I would be dead in a few turns after healings run out and chain summoners take over the level. Than i checked my inventory again...and what do I see? That beautiful lovely earthquake weapon. So what? I grabbed it and started swinging (+40 speed helps so i could have a sip of healing after each strike), and in very little time it was only 1-2 monster in my LoS each turn, giving me a splendid chanche to pull back and take a more careful approach. Even better, where I cleaned away the rocks the lava turned into ground so I could even rest if i wanted to. A lucky escape from a fight where i would have deserved to die due to being a complete idjot. Moral: Most of the people think earthquakes are a warriors enemy and dumbness is his friend. The truth is it is exactly the other way around.

<a href="./ElIott">ElIott</a>:  Another story from an entry to the Jack-of-all-Trades competition.  Sorry for posting two, but this one literally happened 5 minutes ago, so I had to.  After recalling from Mt Doom, Terror (the character's name - Skeleton Dunedain Demonologist) couldn't recall back into Angband and begin hunting Sauron for the One Ring, so he trotted over to Angband, went down to level 67, and read a word of recall scroll.  The level had a FF quest for GWoL and in a move of spectacular stupidity, I had Terror wander away from the stairs. 
</p>
<p>
It was a very small level and all the worms are packed into two smallish rooms with nowhere to hide.  They immediately start beating on Terror and summoning Ancient Dragons.  He's next to a wall, though, and uses Nain to dig a little alcove, which means that at least SOME of the GWoL and their summons can't see him.  Terror makes his stand, hacking away at the Wyrms.  Gothmog's sword really comes in handy as it occasionally teleports a Wyrm away or drains life, both of which help a lot (if he had the whole set, he probably could have just killed them all).   
</p>
<p>
So he's trying not to kill them, just knock them down to 1 or 2 stars, so that he'll be surrounded by damaged wyrms that don't do nearly as much damage with their breath.  The tactic works ok, but there are too many of them.  Finally, his potions are gone, and he's down to about 60% health left.  Hmm.  Is this it for Terror?  While considering his options, I notice that he only needs about 80K exp to make the next level.  That would be nice to do before he dies.  What level is he now?  44.  Hmm, wait a minute...  AH HA! 
</p>
<p>
Terror quickly finishes off a couple badly injured Wyrms that are right next to him, and then its a race to see if he can kill that GWoT before his HP runs out.  And with 200 hp left, the wyrm goes down, Terror levels, and right on cue, *POOF*, the thunderlord appears.  Uh, yes, I think I would be EXTREMELY willing to see Turgon right now.  I've never been so glad to see that quest. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./DanielJoo">DanielJoo</a>: haha. that is actually pretty big time luck there. and funny a bit. sounds like the Valar really like your JOATs.  
</p>
<p>
<a href="./VelKrov">VelKrov</a>: That's the first time I ever heard someone's actually thankful for the apearance of that thunderlord. He usually comes at a bad time for me, when the level's all littered with artifacts. =) 
</p>
<hr size="3">
 <p>
<a href="./SimonSorc">SimonSorc</a>: Heh. Mine is about artifacts too. 
</p>
<p>
I was in Angband level 86 last month with 3 HP left, 4 sanity, and had just hit a trap that makes more traps. As I had hit a trap of drop all 1 step before I was out of healing potions, books, or even bottles + essences that I was in the process of picking up. I'm also hallulcinating and I know there are some unknown monsters around with sanity attacks and sound breath! So what did I do? After some thinking, I decided to walk on a trap (from hitting the trap of multiply I knew it was next to me) hoping for a teleport so I'd live. I lived allright, but was level teleported down one level and lost all! I managed to get the essences for a recall scroll and returned home but I had lost a ring of speed -19!!! It could have been a dream come true if that baby flipped around... also lost a few goodies but I've since found adequate replacements for all things with "resist" in it. Then I upgraded my artifact, went to the barrows-down level 2 looking for floating eye corpses(alchemists need them with artifact creation for ESP ALL), and got killed by a floating eye as I forgot to add free action to my new artifact first (the ingredient "iron spike" was in my death inventory)!!!! 
</p>
<p>
So basically I lived thru sheer luck in face of incredible odds, only to be killed for the lack of using up one iron spike when adding to my artifact one minute before! *yells a self-curse that makes even Morgoth cover his ears and cringe* 
</p>
<p>
...and now you know how nastily cursed artifacts are created. It's an alchemist's last breath of self-loathing anger and very low sanity thing! (-; 
</p>

<strong><a href="./KhymChanur">KhymChanur</a></strong>: Just last night, playing a Lost Soul Sorceror in Theme, at level 98 or 97 of the Halls, I saw something I wanted to get, and a Chaos Hound a ways over.  I thought "No problem"... forgetting that I had neither chaos <em>nor</em> confusion resistance.  Stupid, stupid, stupid!  One breath reduced me to around 10% HP, hallucinated me <strong>and</strong> confused me.  Couldn't cast any spells or read and scrolls.  So I drink two unidentified potions, neither of which do anything, and <em>then</em> stumble on over to the walls and manage to make it inside (having wraithform from being in the Halls).  And the Hound didn't breathe or get close enough to bite during the whole time. 
</p>

 <p>
<strong>Mike the Monk</strong>: My level 13ish Orc Polearmsmaster thought that since 1 Novice Paladin is no problem then 10-13 on an arena level should also be no problem. Before even touching one I'm in  the red from all the pointing and cursing. No teleport scrolls, no potions of healing of any description (you can tell this is one of my early efforts) I look in my inventory and find a  potion of booze that for some reason didn't drop. It thrown into their midst, they all become  confused and whack each other and I flee to fight again another day.
