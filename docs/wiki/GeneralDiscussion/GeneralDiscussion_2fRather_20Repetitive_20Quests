<a href="./RavenRed">RavenRed</a>: Has anyone here ever had repeated quests for the same monster? You just finish the FF quest for 19 Trappers and then two levels later you get another FF Quest for 16 Trappers.... and you still don't have See Invisible... not that it would be a lot of help if you did... This has happened quite a few times, with various monsters and I'm just wondering whether the RNG is being especially cruel or if there's something in the code that's too lazy to think of a new monster every time... <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile4.png" alt=";-)" height="15" width="15"> <p>
My bet is on RNG sadism. Ohhhh no... ANOTHER quest for Greater Draconic Qulthyugs... &lt;sigh&gt; Can't FF lose his Sword to some nice easy Water Hounds or something?  
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":-)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./NeilStevens">NeilStevens</a>: Greater Draconic Qs are among my most favorite monsters in the whole game.  I'd feel lucky to run into them over and over! 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./RavenRed">RavenRed</a>: &lt;shudder&gt; You sure you're not Lord Dimwit? You're showing a frightening degree of masochism...  
</p>
<p>
<a href="./NeilStevens">NeilStevens</a>:  Not masochism, just a tendency to have four immunities by the time I run into them.  You won't see me stay long on a level with other Greater Qs. It's just the Draconic ones that I like to fight for hours and collect thousands of items from. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./RavenRed">RavenRed</a>: Oh... for Farming purposes, fair enough... I wonder if Farmer Maggot has a few GDQ's them stashed in a back shed somewhere... "A-yuh... looks like the spawnin' season's almost on us... gonna be a good crop a'G<a class="nonexistent" href="./WoPs">WoPs</a> this year to take t'the market in Bree. At least those the foxes don't git first..."  <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile4.png" alt=";-)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./MassimilianoMarangio">MassimilianoMarangio</a>: The code in question is in gen_random_quests in birth.c. Normally, a 5-10 level OOD monster is chosen, but there is a small chance of an additional boost (up to 20 level OOD). Since there are many restrictions (not a breeder, not a good monster, not a pet,...) it is possible that only a few creatures of a given level are available, resulting in repeated quests. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./RavenRed">RavenRed</a>: So if it gets that additional boost, it's a flat 20 levels, which means there's (potentially) a limited selection? That explains that. Would making it 18-20 or 15-20 fix... oh well.. it's not a major problem. After all... if it keeps Neil in GDQs... <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile4.png" alt=";-)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
Simon: Eeeeesh. 20 level out of depth critters in barrows-down level 1. This calls for a boycott of the barrows-down for a long while... 
</p>
<p>
Anyway. The lost sword backstory, as well as the princess, kinda get repetitive as storylines. We could diversify the text without changing much code functionality to get other quest types: 
</p>
<p>
FF-types: 
</p>
<p>
"I'm dying because of large kobold attacks. Arrrrgh. Avenge me!" 
</p>
<p>
"I lost a historic document right next to the large kobold. Could you get it for me?" 
</p>
<p>
"I'm an alchemist and I need my special ingredient pouch back. Please take out those eye druj for me!" 
</p>
<p>
Princess types: 
</p>
<p>
"I'm just a honest miner who dug too close to a dungeon. Please free me!" 
</p>
<p>
"Hello champion. I'm gonna test your worth by making you face my pet red dragons! Are you worthy?" 
</p>
<p>
"Please save my kitten in the tree near the Trolls! You wouldn't let a little girl down would you?" 
</p>
<p>
I'm sure you can think of better lines for them to say. The FF quest is getting OLD, and maybe FF-types should get a name and a description of his own like the princess. And saving 68 princesses is totally bogus, some of them should simply be attractive women with family connections as generated by the social class generator or something. (-; 
</p>
<p>
As I said, very little code change could go a long way here. 
</p>
<p>
Also, if we could kill FF and keep the sword (Melkor worship demands it), or charm the princess or whatever, it would mean that quests don't have very limited outcomes... I just *HATE* a princess quest when I'm all equipped... 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./NeilStevens">NeilStevens</a>: Quest getting old?  Nobody makes you turn on 98 quests, you know.  In fact, if you do, you're probably greatly reducing your odds of winning! 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./NerdanelVampire">NerdanelVampire</a>: A percentage of all former princesses could be turned to princes just for flavor and for the benefit of straight female and gay male adventurers. Additionally, there could be crown princes and crown princesses that may appear only deep in the dungeons and give better rewards on the average than ordinary princes(ses). 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a>: RavenRed, I posted about repeated quests over on the forum some time ago... umm... probably in spoilers somewhere. Also, I think there was some discussion from others there, too, along the lines of variation on quest invitations. But anyway, who <em>doesn't</em> want a quest for 20 Great Storm Wyrms?? And another one thereafter? <em>Come to Mama,</em> I say! <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> (And yes, I just got a second quest for Nycadaemons in Angband, oh my.) 
</p>
<p>
Nerdanel... ooooooh. Fun idea, but probably there aren't THAT many crown prince/sses around. Then again, there's probably not that many regular princess around, either, so that's not a good argument. &lt;g&gt; OTOH, I've always thought of FF as an extremely inbred Prince.... 
</p>
<p>
Bandobras: The "kitten" and "you wouldn't let a little girl down" text and the others are just wonderful! <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> Not that I would read them, but upon seeing a kitten inside the glass wall, I would recollect the text, and smile for the next 3 levels. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> Come on, people, invent some more, and let us beg the maintainers for the inclusion (I guess no module trial period would be neccesary here?). Perhaps some Tolkienian flavor there, as well?  Yeah, I get it: "you wouldn't let a little elvish girl down" --- elvish little girls possess some rather nice toys, I imagine. (comment from Simon: that would explain where junkarts come from. And change "activates for something weird" to "activates to amuse little elvish children") 
</p>
<p>
This gives me an idea of another type of quests, similar to FF. Surely someone have already suggested that: gather lost ponys (or other pets). When all the pets are within 10 squares of the player, you get a reward. If one of them dies, repeat over. Of course, a quest with nonmoving pets would be very annoying. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a>: Bandobras: the 'gathering' type of quest has already been suggested over on the forum. Well, not exactly (iirc) but there was some discussion of escorting a creature or group of creatures in order to complete the quest. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./NeilStevens">NeilStevens</a>: It was discussed on the forum.  So? 
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a></strong>: So, digging around on the forum (and linking to whatever is found there) might be beneficial to this discussion. I'm not saying Bandobras' idea is a bad one. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="./NeilStevens">NeilStevens</a></strong>: An impossible task, I must say.  The pathetic unsearchability of that thing is a major reason we have this wiki today, heh.

<strong><a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a></strong>: MY HERO!!! <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> (I think the caps are deserved, this time around. &lt;g&gt;) Seriously, there are some truly good ideas lying about rotting away in the forum, and it'd be sad to lose them. Thank you, MM! 
</p>
<p>
Simon: and if I grok the reason behind the success of the game "runescape" correctly, it's the fact that no two quests are alike or repeat at all that gave the game such a high flavor, theme, and humor. They rock! 
</p>
<p>
Some more ideas (they're coding intensive, unlike the simple "replace some text" idea which will come first because it's easy...) 
</p>
<p>
-Save the rangers from the orcs! (kill all orcs with at least half the rangers still alive). One quest maximum per "good monster" type. Can be failed. Reward a few ranger-type skills points(or novice warrior skill... etc). If you're evil you can save the orcs from the rangers and always get a warrior-type skill instead (or priest for ego Trolls). (-; 
</p>
<p>
-Find an informer: one of the humanoid monsters will not attack you, but you have no other way of knowing than looking at his behavior. Let him go next to you unharmed and he will defect! This quest is not given directly, it is a discrete part of the level feeling that becomes visible after 500 turns ("geez, so many footprints here, there must be an army hidden somewhere near!"). Reward: a bonus quest level (sort of like a death fate, but nicer because you're caught a large evil army in their sleep/drunk state - unarmored and slow!). 
</p>
<p>
-A great hero has died and his ghost wants revenge! If you succeed in killing a vault full of monsters you will gain a fate for some cool out-of-depth item. If you ignore the quest you get the weaker fate "you may be fated to die on level ..." but not "you are fated to die...". 
</p>
<p>
-You stumble upon an unstable void gate. It leads to either the top or the near-bottom of the dungeon. Jumping in might give you a corruption or kill you outright! Do you feel lucky, punk? 
</p>
<p>
-The deal: a witch wants to trade your most valuable artifact for one of his; you have 3 choices and you CAN look at the items first once you save the witch from the witch hunt, killing a few well-meaning but maybe misguided monsters. (-;  Killing her is an option, but if you do that the 3 artifacts she drops will be permacurse, aggravate, their pval lowered by 2, etc!! Say bye bye to ringil, it's been cursed by greater witchcraft!! 
</p>
<p>
-The great dragon farm has been opened by Morgoth's forces, and Eranoer the half-elf (legendary maker of dragon armors) wants you to kill all dragons and bring him one dragon corpse (of your choice) so he can make you a dragon armor for you. This will be his masterpiece before he retires ("to the great wyrm farm in the sky", he says). The dragon armor type depends on the corpse. Eranoer will appear on another level much deeper with the armor in his hands; he will give it to you and recall out. The longer you have to wait for the armor (counted in dungeon depth difference), the better the armor will be. 
</p>
<p>
-A special kind of rust affects all non-ego/artifact items on this level; it's caused by the emanations of a truly huge jelly pit. You may avoid the pit entirely, but know this: only ego and artifact items are scattered in the pit (those ego and artifact items aren't out of depth, they're calculated to be at "half depth" so the game isn't unbalanced. But hey so many ego/artifacts in the same level... whoooa!). If you leave this level, the jelly pit collapse making the level unique you can't retry later.    (hint: any player powerful enough to KNOW he can take on a giant jelly pit unprepared is not gonna find much useful here. For others it's so tempting... so dangerous. But so tempting...) 
</p>
<p>
-Elf &amp; dark elf romance: you have to go back and forth between a "romeo" and a "juliette" type monster delivering love letters, but in ToME theme(I didn't read the books - whoever did can give us theme). You must do so in a limited number of turns; failing to deliver in time twice in a row will fail the quest ("Juliette" gets an arranged wedding she doesn't like). Being in line of sight of Juliette's father counts as slower message delivery, but alas you can't kill him! Delivering in time quick enough twice in a row results in a happy wedding. Gods smile upon this wedding and you get +1d6 luck forever. Monsters appear in nonrandom patterns in the way and get tougher each time; so at some point it's wiser to let the quest fail than to get more and more out of depth monster generation here! This quest is skippable. 
</p>
<p>
-You get a fate for "an important historical relic". If you do find it (this old piece of junk will be generated once only) you get a sizeable cash reward. 
</p>
<p>
-You find a helpless kitten. Feed it and it will follow you(they DON'T eat mushrooms of unhealth or slime molds!). The "sad elvish little girl" unique is sometimes generated in town (sort of like joke monster Mathilde that "skips happily" and "waves"), and will reward you if you bring the kittens back alive. The reward is a scroll of artifact creation. After that unique is generated with a different text "happy little elvish girl". 
</p>
<p>
-Some crazy but powerful ancient mage (well, he says he's all powerful anyway) is tinkering stuff in his lab (some junkarts are in this special room - useless/bad ones - among various junk and essences). You notice an odd demonic red glowing in his eyes as well as thick red skin - a corruption no doubt! He wants to make a specific junkart power (randomly choosen) but can't quite make it, so he asks you if you have a junkart that does that. If so, you are rewarded with a junkart among 3 randomly selected nice (not overpowerful) activations. You can see in advance what they activate for. You get to name the junkart. (-; 
</p>
<p>
(spoiler: you MAY lie to him and give him just any junkart, he's too crazy to realize he's being scammed 50% of the time, but if he realizes you scammed him he will give you a heavy curse and curse-no-drop junkart of gain corruption, saying "In a century and a day, you will be able to give it to a liar. I've had it long enough, now it's YOUR TURN!"). 
</p>
<p>
-A legendary adventurer is hallulcinating badly, stuck in a small floor space surrounded by pits(or whatever makes you fall is called). There is but one patch of hallulcination-causing mushroom on the other side of the pit, easily taken care of. Your task, which will NOT be explained to you, is to get him down to less than 10 hit points so that he can be forced to quaff a potion of cure insanity(one is present - hoping the player will recognize it!). Reward: he's in your own religion(unbelievers get a nifty dark sword, non-believers get a randart), and will be able to craft the 5 god relics parts back into the original relic thru his master craftsmanship. This gives you 5 more skill point in prayer for having done all God quests; and when the relic is complete, it is an artifact which depends on which God you worship. 
</p>
<p>
Well more ideas here, but I'll wait until I see some coding to take my chances of being implemented seriously...
