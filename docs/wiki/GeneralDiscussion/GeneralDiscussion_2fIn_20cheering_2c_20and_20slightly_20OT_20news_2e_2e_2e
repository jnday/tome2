<a href="./RavenRed">RavenRed</a>: ... in a survey run to find Australia's Favourite Book, Lord of the Rings came out number one, beating Pride and Prejudice and the bible in the top three, with the Hobbit coming in at 26. I know this choice mimics the choice in a UK survey a year or two back. Although some of this can no doubt be put down to Peter Jackson, I'd like to think that it reflects a deeper fascination and affection for Arda, of which *bands and ToME are yet another loving facet...  <p>
<a href="./SimonSorc">SimonSorc</a>: At least we're not getting this web site mentionned. Web sites merely mentionned by slashdot.com and such get deluges of curious visitors all at once and some servers can't take it - resulting in 12 to 48 hours of shortage depending how curious the public gets. 
</p>
<p>
We may yet get the 'Most timeless game ever' award. In 2364 when we finally finish the graphic thingy. (-;

<p>
<strong><a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a></strong>: <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/attention.png" alt="<!>" height="15" width="15"> Australia has <em>Pride and Predjudice</em> in the top three? Wow. I have to admit I'm shocked. It's a wonderful book, of course... but Aussies are only now figuring this out? (Last statement meant jokingly; no disrespect intended.) Also shocked since while it's a highschool read, it's not exactly your basic pulp fiction... which means they also have excellent taste. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15"> (I mean, hey, Tolkien's #1, so we knew that already!) 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./RavenRed">RavenRed</a>: I'll magnanimously ignore that. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile4.png" alt=";-)" height="15" width="15"> I was pleasantly surprised it was up there, as well. Dan Brown's <em>The Da Vinci Code</em> was also up in the top 10 (there was a big *groan* from the studio audience when that was read out). The ten were:

A pretty good selection of desert island books. Only two Aus books in there, but Australians have never been known for their patriotism. (Principle: If it comes from overseas, it must be better).  
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a></strong>: Good grief... <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, <em>1984</em>, and <em>Catch-22</em>, also?!?!? Again, sounds like more of a basic high school reading list to me. (Which, I guess, is a good thing.) Catch-22 is an excellent novel, btw. <em>Ou sont les Snowdens d'antan?</em> (minus proper punctuaction.) Still, like I said before, that points to a higher intellectual level; good stuff. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15"> I'll have to look at Cloud Street and A Fortunate Life. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="./RavenRed">RavenRed</a></strong>: By coincidence, I just read Catch 22 the other week in Bali. It's a vicious little screed, which is all to the good, although I probably shouldn't have tried to read it on the plane on the way back, as it does mainly deal with airplanes going crash/splash... <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":-)" height="15" width="15"> The comment on To Kill A Mockingbird was that "it got here on worthines, more than anything else". It's a populist list, rather than a literary list, to be sure, and I'd question Hitchhiker's Guide having a place on it (let alone the Da Vinci Code). Unfortunately, Silmarillion didn't make the top 100... 
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="./ElIott">ElIott</a></strong>:  Wow.  That's an outstanding list of books.  I'm not familiar with what I assume are the Australian ones, but that's awfully good company.  Even the Da Vinci Code, though certainly overrated, really isn't that bad as far as popular novels go and (IMO) The Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy is a work of genius, though I recognize that people sadly born without a sense of humor may disagree. I'll quibble with listing LoTR as a single book (obviously its now 3, but was originally 6, right?), though since I'm here, I'm obviously not going to disagree with its inclusion, nor its deserved status as #1.  Looking at the Harry Potter entry not as the book itself (arguably the weakest of the lot, so far), but as a representation of the series, then I think it really does deserve to be there.  Had the US come up with a similar list, it probaly would have started with People magazine.  Go Aussies!  Well done.   
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="./BurbLulls">BurbLulls</a></strong>: That Hitchhiker's Guide to Galaxy is a work of genius, and probably my favourite book, including LoTR (Heathen!) I've read 4 out of the 10 of them, that surprised me. 
</p>
<hr>
 <strong><a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a></strong>: Well, hey: It <em>would</em> be completely off topic, but on the other hand, we are a community. So, how about a meta-thread for recommended books? We all (I should think) share a common interest in Professor J.R.R. Tolkien's works and in gaming. While the rest of our lives may potentially be wildly divergent, we might enjoy some additional reading material in common. Basic structure idea: The main thread would contain listings for individual books (or trilogies/series etc.), while subthreads would contain discussion on them. Thoughts, anyone? </div><div id="footer">
