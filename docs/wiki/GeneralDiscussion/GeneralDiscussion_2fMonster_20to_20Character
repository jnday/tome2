<a href="./RavenRed">RavenRed</a>: What kind of monster would you most like to become a playable character race?  <p>
What monster race do people think could become an enjoyable <em>character</em> race to play? 
</p>
<p>
(please note, this is a slightly silly exercise) 
</p>
<p>
Personally, I'm plumping for poisonous jellies. Althought they start off with perhaps -50 to walking speed, they quickly level up (think Ochre Jellies and Acidic Cytoplasms) to have natural +20 speed at Clev50 . Unable to wear or wield anything, they gain immunities to poison and acid, whilst remaining sensitive to fire. They have masses of HP and regeneration, along with an innate poison touch (or acid) to their barehand combat. Mage-Jellies (like gibbering mouthers, without the breeding) could become fearsome piles O' flesh, wheras Monk-Jellies could eat through all in their way...  
</p>
<p>
Any other ideas?  
</p>
<p>
<a href="./RogerBarnett">RogerBarnett</a>: Sounds good, though I suspect that not being able to wear/wield *anything* at all might be a little too much. Perhaps limiting the jelly to only being able to wear body armour, a cloak, helm, boots and gloves - all the things that it can ooze into and drag around. This would still weaken the character - no rings, no weapons, no shields, no amulets, no light sources. Would be a novelty character, but it would be interesting to see if it could be done. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a></strong>: Druj. They'd probably end up as a variant on a Deathmold, but considering how much I despise them, they might be fun to play. If they ended up working, you might pick 'druj' as you pick 'warrior', then pick a subclass... eye, hand, etc. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="./RedNaga">RedNaga</a></strong>: The eye-tyrants revenge. Beholders! They could have lots of hit dice (12?), high costitution, intelligence and wisdom, low dexterity and very low charisma, innate levitation and ESP at higher level. Equipment slots would be 6 rings and 2 amulets (worn around the eyestalks), maybe a light source (just to be nice <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> ). Of course without considering the limitations on equipment slots (they will still be on ToME 3?), it would be instead ten rings and one amulet. It could attack only like the weaponless bodies for fixed damage (15-25?) or optionally with barehanded combat, and would have *many* racial powers. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="./BurbLulls">BurbLulls</a></strong>: Golems! All pretty dim warrior classes resistant to poison, intrinsic free action and hold life at later levels. Low CHR, WIS and INT, high CON and STR. It's been done before, but we could have subclasses! 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
<em>Flesh</em>: Only class able to get benefits from food, non-resistant to poison. Weaker hit dice. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
<em>Clay</em>: As weak as a flesh golem, but gains resistance to the four basic elements; first fire, then cold, then electricity, then acid. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
<em>Wood</em>: Essentially an Ent :), but no poison resistance as well. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
<em>Iron</em>: The 'base' Golem. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
<em>Eog</em>: Higher EXP penalty and hit dice, excellent saving throw. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
<em>Hru</em>: INSANE hit dice and melee damage, intrinsic earthquakes and -10 speed. 900% exp penalty. 
</p>
</li>

        <ul>

  <strong><a href="./ZasVid">ZasVid</a></strong>: Hrus are giants, not golems. <p>
  <strong><a href="./RedNaga">RedNaga</a></strong>: They might appear as grey 'P', but their description says they are made of living rock... i think they qualify <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>

        </ul>    </ul>


<p>
<strong><a href="./ZasVid">ZasVid</a></strong>: I'd like to play... hoom... Creeping Coins! ;D No, really. Several different subraces with various powers. They can create gold out of they current hp (yeah, quite cheesy, because you could repeat ad infinitum and get tons of cash for tons of turns. but hey, we're playing a pile of coins!). Limited equipment slots. Actually, what it could wear? I don't have an idea. Maybe rings, amulets and light sources. Anyone knows whether ToME 3 will be able to support something like 'generic equipment slot'? I.e. coins get 10 equipment slots and you can put there 10 rings, 10 amulets, 10 light sources or whatever combination of them. This'd be cool! 
</p>

        <ul>

  <strong><a href="./BurbLulls">BurbLulls</a></strong>: They'd have to aggravate... at least the gold-grabbin Dwarves anyway! <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15"> 
        </ul>


<p>
<strong><a href="./VelKrov">VelKrov</a></strong>: Dragons of course! Innate breath, levitation (flying at later levels), dragon body, 300% xp penalty (like thunderlords, in fact dragons are very much like thunderlords). 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./NerdanelVampire">NerdanelVampire</a>: You can play dragons in several modules. But what I'd like to play is a Marilith. It could easily be overpowered, but having three weapons without mimicry would be fun. Mariliths would have no boot slot due to their serpentine lower body, and probably some other minuses like really bad stealth and low INT/WIS/CHR. Even their other stats wouldn't have to be more than average by default. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="./AgEnt">AgEnt</a></strong>:  Since druj and jellies were mentioned, why not have a whole set of non-moving monster races?  You could have the deathmolds, druj (good casters), quylthulgs (summoners), mimics (intrinsic invisibility), eyes (special attacks), mushrooms (uhhh... non-moving yeeks?)...  And then symbiosis could let you have a moving symbiote, instead of another non-moving, so you could walk around with a kobold symbiote (or a Great Wyrm of Power)!  Probably overpowered, though, and very silly.
