<p>
Well, I seem to be having a rash of bad luck with characters dying here. 
</p>
<p>
"You mean bad playing, don't you, Human?" 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15"> You know, <a class="external" href="./www.killerbunnies.org/angband/ladder/gath/gath_4.html"><img src="./wiki/classic/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">Gathraka</a>, I don't think you really want me mad at you.  After all, I <em>could</em> send you back into the Spiders quest at, say, clvl&#160;1, naked, unarmed, and with a Potion of Slowness in your belly. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, and I <em>could</em> come up there and rearrange your nose so it fits up your&#8211;" 
</p>
<p>
<em>As</em> I was saying&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> here I am starting Lisa over again, and I never really could decide which one to DitL anyway, and I <em>am</em> a glutton for punishment, after all, so why not do both?  I'd better be careful with my <a class="external" href="./www.killerbunnies.org/angband/ladder/geo/geo_1.html"><img src="./wiki/classic/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">Geomancer</a> at this rate, or I might inadvertently end up with a trifecta here. 
</p>
<p>
"Uh&#8230; could we talk about that?" 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> And so I give you&#8230; strange; she should have been here by now. 
</p>
<p>
"You sense it too, then." 
</p>
<p>
Wh&#8211;?  Galadriel?  What are <em>you</em> doing here? 
</p>
<p>
"The same as you, I expect.  Something is coming&#8212;a portent of some great significance, but I know not what." 
</p>
<p>
Well, I imagine it has something to do with this interdimensional vortex that just opened up in front of us. 
</p>
<p>
"As you say." 
</p>
<p>
"Waaaagh!" <em>*thud*</em>  "Ow.  That was undignified."  <em>[sound F/X:  vortex closing]</em>  "Hey&#8211;!  Great, so now I'm stuck here&#8212;wherever 'here' is&#8230; Definitely not Mars Colony; gravity feels like Earth normal. Hey, you two, where am I?" 
</p>
<p>
"We are not far outside the human town of Bree." 
</p>
<p>
"Bree?  Never heard of it, doesn't tell me anything.  What planet am I on?" 
</p>
<p>
"&#8216;Planet&#8217;?  I do not understand.  This is Arda, the World, embodiment of the Great Music of Eru Ilúvatar." 
</p>
<p>
"O-<em>kaaay</em>, she talks like a Minbari, but she looks like a Vulcan.  You look human enough, you wanna help me out here?" 
</p>
<p>
Oh, dear.  This could be tricky to explain&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"Well, you can start with the three-foot tall guy over there with the waistcoat and the furry feet." 
</p>
<p>
Ah, now that's a Hobbit. 
</p>
<p>
"A <em>Hobbit</em>?!  Are you telling me I've landed in the middle of some kind of dungeons-and-dragons<sup><a href="#fndef-c804b611e7038746e2d12746a5e266c0a0542257-0" id="fnref-c804b611e7038746e2d12746a5e266c0a0542257-0">1</a></sup> story?" 
</p>
<p>
Well&#8230; actually, that's probably about as good an explanation as any other I could offer. 
</p>
<p>
"That's nice.  I'd like to go home now, please." 
</p>
<p>
"That will not be a simple task, I fear.  This magic that has brought you here, it bears the stench of Morgoth." 
</p>
<p>
"Morgoth?" 
</p>
<p>
Head badguy of the, um, story. 
</p>
<p>
"Ah.  So what does he want with me?" 
</p>
<p>
"I fear you will have to confront him to learn his intentions&#8212;and to return from whence you came, it may well fall upon you to destroy him." 
</p>
<p>
"Okay, fine, tell me where he is and I'll go tie his brain in pretzel knots&#8230;" <em>[squints]</em> "&#8230;or not.  I can't read either of you. Jeez, don't tell me I've lost my telepathy in the bargain too." 
</p>
<p>
Your psi powers will work differently in Arda; it'll take some time for you to regain them fully. 
</p>
<p>
"This just keeps getting worse, doesn't it?  So what am I supposed to do till then?" 
</p>
<p>
"Do not despair; there is yet hope.  See! that weapon there emerged also from the portal that brought you here." 
</p>
<p>
"What, this mace?  Yeah, I saw it as I was falling out."  <em>[picks up mace]</em> "Thought it was gonna clock me on the head there for a minute. Hmm, there's some kind of symbol on it." 
</p>
<p>
"That is the mark of Tulkas Astaldo, the Valiant.  It seems he has taken you as his champion, and will aid you in your quest." 
</p>
<p>
"Uh-<em>huh</em>.  And Tulkas is&#8230;?" 
</p>
<p>
One of the local gods, more or less. 
</p>
<p>
"What?  Hey, whoa, hold on, Elf lady, I didn't sign up to be some kind of fraggin' Joan of Arc here." 
</p>
<p>
Can't be helped, I'm afraid; Mindcrafter is a subclass of Priest for no reason I can discern, so you had to have <em>some</em> god, and Tulkas seemed the best fit for my planned strategy. 
</p>
<p>
"Terrific.  So now what do I do?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, Bree would probably be a good place to start. 
</p>
<p>
<em>(shrug)</em> "Hobbitsville it is, then.  Man, why couldn't this Morgoth guy have grabbed Mom instead of me?  She could probably melt his brain from here without trying hard." 
</p>
<p>
Which is probably exactly why he chose you instead&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  Anyway, as always, here are the technical details:  maximize and preserve modes on, no non-main monsters, 49 random quests, and point-based stat allocation, netting starting stats 14,10,18/30,11,11,12.

(Lisa's previous incarnation followed Manwe, but I concluded that there's just too much overlap between Manwe's Blessing and Adrenaline Channeling.)

<p>
In what might be a bad omen, a Mangy-looking leper poisons me and takes me down to 0/12hp before the poison wears off. 
</p>
<p>
<em>*wheeze*</em> "Good grief, they let people like that just wander the streets in this place?  Don't they have hospitals or quarantines or something?" 
</p>
<p>
Not really, no.  Don't worry, though; before long you'll be tough enough that they can't hurt you. 
</p>
<p>
"If that was meant to be reassuring, your bedside manner stinks.  Hmm, well, for starters, if I'm gonna be stuck here long-term, I need a place to sleep." 
</p>
<p>
Precisely, which is why our first task is to take the:

<h4 id="head-6e237497533f095fbd35938096e536b9ceb5f16d">Thieves Quest</h4>
<p>
<em>You feel a vicious blow on your head&#8230;</em> 
</p>
<p>
"Ow." <em>[rubs head]</em>  "Sheesh, first I'm some kind of crusader or something, now I'm law enforcement?  Can we make up our minds here?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, this <em>is</em> the easiest way to get you a place to live. 
</p>
<p>
"Don't they have police or shirriffs or whatever they're called to handle this sort of thing?  Nah, scratch that, if they had police, they wouldn't have poisonous people wandering the streets.  Okay, with my psi powers shot, how am I supposed to deal with these thieves?  They took all my stuff, so the bash-&#8216;em-over-the-head option is out." 
</p>
<p>
Actually, your equipment is in a room right down the hall. 
</p>
<p>
"Unguarded?  Not terribly bright, these thieves." 
</p>
<p>
As you say.  They did have the foresight, though, to put an alarm on the door you just opened. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, so I noticed.  Thanks for the advance warning." 
</p>
<p>
Sorry.  A quick switch to berzerker/running, and the first Novice rogue takes me to <em>clvl&#160;2</em>; I throw all five skill points into Mindcraft. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, I think you were right;  I can feel my powers starting to come back. Lemme try it on this next guy&#8211;" 
</p>
<p>
Let's take a few steps back first, in case you don't get him in one shot. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, good thinking.  Okay, here goes:  <em>PAIN</em>&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Three Neural Blasts takes out the next Novice rogue.  I'm down to 2/7 mana and the next rogue is only a square away; I give him another Neural Blast and then bash him over the head, as Lisa so delicately put it. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
<em>*huff*</em> "I think I might have spoken too soon.  I'm wiped here." 
</p>
<p>
We need to back up to the north corridor and rest, get your mana back. That done, I lure out the Novice rogue who followed me and was stuck in the alcove; three more Neural Blasts in his face and I'm <em>clvl&#160;3</em>&#8212;and Tulkas brings out the first relic quest, southwest of Bree and northwest of Minas Anor. 
</p>
<p>
<em>*wince*</em> "Oh, terrific, so the Elf lady wasn't kidding about this god-champion thing?" 
</p>
<p>
&#8216;Fraid not. 
</p>
<p>
"So what is this relic he wants me to go find?" 
</p>
<p>
That can wait for a bit; we need to finish dealing with the thieves first. Skill points go 2 to Mindcraft and 3 to Magic, to give me a bit of mana to work with. 
</p>
<p>
Back in the main room, I pick off the Novice warrior, send another Novice rogue fleeing, and lure the Bandit out into the corridor.  Seven Neural Blasts later, he's dead and I'm <em>clvl&#160;6</em>; the 15 total skill points go 3 to Mindcraft and 12 to Combat. 
</p>
<p>
"So, you really expect me to fight my way through this, huh?" 
</p>
<p>
Yes.  You're going to run into monsters that aren't affected by your psi powers, and some that are too strong to be dealt with purely mentally. 
</p>
<p>
<em>(shrug)</em> "Okay, I'm game.  Who else we got in here?" 
</p>
<p>
The rest of the quest proceeds without incident, and we return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
The Bandit's dagger turns out to be (+1,+3).  Normally I'd sell it, but it does better damage than the Mace, and it's a <em>lot</em> lighter. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, I'll second that.  This thing is like swinging a brick.  I'm not trained for physical combat, you know.  Gimme a PPG and I'd be much better off." 
</p>
<p>
I'm afraid Arda doesn't have PPGs.  Instead, I buy some light armor pieces and a few !oCSW's that are on sale. 
</p>
<p>
"So now, what, we go get the relic thing?" 
</p>
<p>
Not yet; I want to do a couple levels of the Downs first. 
</p>

<h4 id="head-19341dbaff4f6b838da506d673dca940d2b658b8">BDw 1 thru BDw 2</h4>
<p>
<strong>BDw 1</strong>; "This level can't be all bad&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"Ooh, delightful decor&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Indeed.  Okay, now we can test some of your psi powers.  Try Precognition; you should be able to sense any nearby monsters. 
</p>
<p>
"Okay&#8230;" <em>[closes eyes and focuses]</em> "Yeah, there's a giant ant of some kind, that way." 
</p>
<p>
A Soldier ant, specifically, in a room to our north. 
</p>
<p>
<em>[slashes dagger]</em> "Eurk.  I suppose I'll get used to this.  Which is not a pleasant thought in itself&#8230;  Hey!  That swirly thing over there!" 
</p>
<p>
You mean the Void jumpgate? 
</p>
<p>
"It looks just like the vortex or whatever that brought me here.  Maybe this one can get me home!" 
</p>
<p>
Um, I wouldn't&#8211; 
</p>
<p>
<em>*whoosh*</em>  "Brr!  What, that's it?  It just took me to the next room over?" 
</p>
<p>
Actually, it took you most of the way across the level.  You'll find these scattered randomly throughout most of the dungeons:  fixed wormholes through the Void, terminating in jumpgates on both ends.  They won't get you anywhere outside the level. 
</p>
<p>
"Mm.  But that <em>is</em> exactly what the vortex that brought me here felt like when I was inside it." 
</p>
<p>
Makes sense, I suppose.  Morgoth probably created a Void wormhole between Arda and your world and pulled you through it. 
</p>
<p>
"So all we've gotta do is make another wormhole that goes back." 
</p>
<p>
<em>(shrug)</em> I don't know of any magic that can do that. 
</p>
<p>
"Well, this Morgoth guy obviously has magic that can do it.  I say we go take it from him." 
</p>
<p>
That <em>is</em> the general idea&#8212;but you're not nearly strong enough yet to take on Morgoth.  We'll need to build up your power a lot before then. Which is why we're here in the Downs, to get a start on that. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, yeah, patience, I know.  Ick!  What's that?" 
</p>
<p>
An apropos choice of words&#8212;it's a White icky thing. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, that much I can see from here.  What <em>is</em> it?" 
</p>
<p>
No, that's literally what it's called. 
</p>
<p>
"Ah.  So the taxonomists in Arda are either mind-numbingly uncreative or have a <em>very</em> weird sense of humor.  Well, it doesn't look friendly, so I'm gonna kill it.  <em>PAIN</em>&#8230;  O-<em>kaay</em>, I don't think that worked." 
</p>
<p>
Icky things are mindless.  See, I told you you were gonna have to fight your way through some of this. 
</p>
<p>
"Yuck.  Okay&#8230;" <em>[slash]</em> "Ick ick ick&#8230; okay, I guess I see where they get their names from." 
</p>
<p>
Indeed.  We spend the rest of the level getting Lisa acclimated to the general travails of the dungeon, and then proceed to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDw 2</strong>:  Fumblefingers quest for 13 Green icky things; "This level can't be all bad&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
"Great, that's more of those things I can't kill with my mind attack, right?" 
</p>
<p>
&#8216;Fraid so.  Precognition is sensing one not far to the north; might as well have at it. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, joy&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Hmm, apparently there were more than one of them in the immediate vicinity. The second one pushes me to <em>clvl&#160;7</em>; I assign skill points 2 to Mindcraft, 1 to Combat, and 2 to Magic, which gets me strong weapon/armor pseudo-ID and the Pulverize Mindcraft power.  This should work better against the Icky things, Lisa. 
</p>
<p>
"Okay, I'm game.  Let's try it on this next one&#8230;"  <em>*WHUMP*</em> "Hey! That was a telekinetic attack.  That can't be right, I'm not a teek." 
</p>
<p>
I told you, your powers will work differently in Arda. 
</p>
<p>
"Wow.  Can I hypnotize monsters and make them fight each other?" 
</p>
<p>
Eventually, yes, but not for a while. 
</p>
<p>
"Cool.  I could get used to this place&#8230;" <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
That's the spirit.  A little further in, an ill-planned run-in with a pack of Cave spiders gives us an excuse to try out Minor and Major Displacement. 
</p>
<p>
"Okay, wait a minute, teleportation doesn't even qualify as a teek power. How did I do that?" 
</p>
<p>
Hmm&#8230; can I get back to you on that?  The fifth Green icky thing takes me to <em>clvl&#160;8</em>, and the tenth takes me to <em>clvl&#160;9</em>; skill points go 2 to Mindcraft and 8 to Magic.  Hmm, I hadn't really planned on leveling up this much before taking on the relic quest; I might have to bail early and go do that. 
</p>
<p>
"Why?  What's the deal?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, ideally, I'd like to get all five relic quests out of the way while you're still fairly low level, so they'll be easier. 
</p>
<p>
"<em>Five</em>?  This guy's got five relics for me to go hunt down?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, five pieces of the same relic.  Also, if we leave it too long, we might not get all five quests, and my skill point plan is built on the assumption that we will. 
</p>
<p>
"Space your skill point plan, I'd like to live long enough to get home." 
</p>
<p>
Rest assured, Lisa, I'm doing everything in my power to ensure that. Anyway, as is common with Fumblefingers quests, I pretty much have to walk the entire level to find the last Green icky thing. 
</p>
<p>
"Figures the last one of those disgusting things would have the stupid sword.  Wait a minute, this looks like tempered steel.  Do they have that kind of tech here?" 
</p>
<p>
Not to my knowledge. 
</p>
<p>
"Ah, my sword!  Thank you for finding it." 
</p>
<p>
"Gaah!" <em>*gasp*</em> "How did you sneak up on me like that?" 
</p>
<p>
"Oh&#8230; well, without my sword, I had to get good at avoiding monsters just to stay alive." 
</p>
<p>
"Uh-<em>huh</em>&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the reward choices are Monster-lore, Combat, Divination and Necromancy.  Hmm, most of Divination would be duplicated by my Mindcraft powers; Monster-lore is of no use, and Necromancy would be out of character.  Combat it is, then&#8212;which will allow me to move three planned skill points out of Combat to some other skill. 
</p>
<p>
"I don't care how sneaky that guy is; I'm a teep, I should've been able to sense him coming.  Something's not right here&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
We'll have to worry about that later; after a quick sweep of the level, I return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
With no quest loot to sell off, shopping is a bit constrained, but I think I'm ready to go looking for the relic quest next time out. 
</p>
<h4 id="head-e025c9703f3fe45c6980a6a95ca4a3d8031c7887">First relic quest</h4>
<p>
The quest entrance is not far from Bree, a straight shot south from the Old Forest.  Hold your breath and here we go: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LTm 2</strong>, take 1 
</p>
<p>
"This level can't be all bad&#8230;"  Okay, Lisa, keep your eyes peeled; we have to search every square inch of this level for the relic. 
</p>
<p>
"Mm.  And this all-knowing Tulkas guy can't give us a hint or something?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, he <em>did</em> get us to to the temple. 
</p>
<p>
"What, &#8216;southwest of Bree&#8217;?  This you call big help?" 
</p>
<p>
You know, this <em>is</em> a god you're trash-talking here.  You're not worried? 
</p>
<p>
"Nah, if he could zap me for blasphemy, he'd be more than capable of recovering his own fraggin' relic." 
</p>
<p>
An interesting theory&#8230;  In the meantime, a few Kobolds push me over the top to <em>clvl&#160;10</em>, with skill points going 1 to Mindcraft, 1 to Magic, 1 to Prayer and 2 to Weaponmastery.  And there appears to be no relic here, so we bounce on the stairs and return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LTm 2</strong>, take 2 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like any other level&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
"Wait, didn't we already search this level?" 
</p>
<p>
We're exploiting a quirk of the quest code:  it tries to place the relic every time a new level is generated, even if it's one you've already been on. 
</p>
<p>
"Mm.  But why couldn't we have just gone down the stairs to the next level?" 
</p>
<p>
Because relic quest levels get tougher faster with increasing depth than normal levels. 
</p>
<p>
"Ooh, someone's gunshy&#8230;" <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
Well, you <em>did</em> say you wanted to survive long enough to get home, yes? 
</p>
<p>
"Mm, point." 
</p>
<p>
Besides, I follow the Zaphod Beeblebrox precept that discretion is the better part of valor and cowardice is the better part of discretion. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  No relic here either, so we try again: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LTm 2</strong>, take 3 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like any other level&#8230;"  A 1x3 small level, so the monsters are a bit tighter packed; I have to pick off half a dozen Novice rogues before I even leave the first room.  This takes me up to <em>clvl&#160;11</em>, with skill points going 1 to Mindcraft, 2 to Prayer, and 2 to Weaponmastery. 
</p>
<p>
"Sheesh, how many more times are we gonna have to search this level?" 
</p>
<p>
None, it turns out&#8212;we just found the relic. 
</p>
<p>
"Ah, so <em>this</em> is what all the fuss was about.  Mm, frankly, I was expecting something more&#8230; I dunno, transcendent." 
</p>
<p>
Well, what about the reward of Prayer skill?  Not transcendent enough for you? 
</p>
<p>
"Enh, I'm more of an agnostic, really." 
</p>
<p>
Okay, so I'll only cast Divine Aim half the time, then. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
"Huh?" 
</p>
<p>
I'll explain later; right now we should return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
and restock in preparation to return to the Downs next time.

</p>
<p>
<em>(shrug)</em> Don't look at me&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"And I guess that makes me the clichéd knight in&#8230; um, padded armor. Is there a dragon for me to heroically slay too?" 
</p>
<p>
Dragons come later, actually. 
</p>
<p>
"I <em>knew</em> I shouldn't have asked.  So, let's go find the fair maiden, then." 
</p>
<p>
The level is uneventful for a while, until I run into my first orcs, a small pack of Snotlings. 
</p>
<p>
"Enh, these don't look so tough.  So where's the princess?" 
</p>
<p>
Um, these aren't the orcs guarding the princess&#8212;and Cave orcs are tougher than Snotlings. 
</p>
<p>
"I should hope so; those guys were pushovers." 
</p>
<p>
Indeed.  A bit further in, a pack of Cave spiders pushes me over the top to <em>clvl&#160;12</em>, with skill points going 1 to Mindcraft, 1 to Magic, and 3 to Weaponmastery. 
</p>
<p>
I finally find the quest room near the northwest corner. 
</p>
<p>
"You're right, these orcs <em>are</em> kinda tough." 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, brave warrior, save me!" 
</p>
<p>
"That's what I'm here for, ma'am.  I'll have you out of there in a second. Now, let's see, where's that mace those Snotlings dropped&#8230; ah, here it is.  Cover your eyes, Your Highness."

<em><strong>*WHANG!*</strong></em> "OOkkaayy, tthhaatt wwaass ssuurrpprriissiinnggllyy iinneeffffeeccttiivvee." 
</p>
<p>
The glass walls are magical.  You have to kill all the Cave orcs to open them. 
</p>
<p>
"Ah.  And speaking of clichés&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Yes, yes.  The quest reward choices are a Broad Sword, a Light Crossbow, or a Rapier.  Hmm, this would give me a chance at a decent weapon; the sword would do a bit more damage, but it weighs a <em>lot</em> more&#8230; I'll take the Rapier, which turns out&#8211; 
</p>
<p>
"Hey!  Did you see that?" 
</p>
<p>
See what?  Sorry, I was looking at the Rapier. 
</p>
<p>
"That princess&#8212;I think she just got sucked into hyperspace!" 
</p>
<p>
It's normal for the princess to vanish after the quest is finished.  That's probably what you saw. 
</p>
<p>
"Excuse me, I <em>know</em> a hyperspace jump point when I see one, mister." 
</p>
<p>
Hey, you could be right; I never really figured out these quests anyway. Anyway, as I was saying, the Rapier turns out to be a Frozen Rapier of *Slay Dragon* (+2,+5) (+1)&#8212;a most suitable weapon for the early game, and it'll sell for a decent price when I find something better.  A quick sweep of the last few bits of the level, and onward to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDw 5</strong>; "You like the look of this place&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Unremarkable for a while.  I hit <em>clvl&#160;13</em> not far in; skill points go 1 to Mindcraft, 1 to Magic and 3 to Weaponmastery.  The rest of the level is uneventful; fast forward to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDw 6</strong>:  Princess quest for 11 Tengu; "You have a good feeling&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Oh, I forgot, I wanted to head up and sell off some of these un-ID'd potions I've been accumulating. 
</p>
<p>
"But what about the damsel in distress?" 
</p>
<p>
She's not going anywhere.  Back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
where I discover too late that one of those un-ID'd potions was a Potion of Wisdom&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/redface.png" alt=":o" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
"What, did we want that?" 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, but we'll find plenty more later.  Since I don't anticipate using it, I'll go ahead and Mathom: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Rounded Pebble 'Travak' (3d6) (+8,+5), with acid, lightning, fire,  frost and poison brand 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
And to my embarrassment, I just noticed I wasn't actually wielding the Rapier from the princess quest&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/redface.png" alt=":o" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
"Sheesh, can I get a new&#8230; narrator?  What <em>are</em> you, anyway?" 
</p>
<p>
&#8216;Narrator&#8217; is close enough.  And no, you're stuck with me. Hmm, the princess quest was for 11 Tengu, which means the lava form of the quest room, so I pick up a Ring of Fire Resistance from the magic shop before returning to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDw 6</strong>:  Princess quest for 11 Tengu, take 2; "You have an excellent feeling&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Hmm, that's a higher level feeling than when we were here the last time. Must be something interesting here this time&#8212;and indeed, Precognition picks up Smeagol not far off. 
</p>
<p>
"Eugh!  That's not a pleasant image, whatever it is.  Is it a badguy?" 
</p>
<p>
Yes. 
</p>
<p>
"Good, let's go get him, then." 
</p>
<p>
That's the spirit. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  Unfortunately, by the time I get to him, Precognition's see invisible has worn off, and Smeagol gets close enough to steal some coin and escape. 
</p>
<p>
"Figures; even fantasy worlds have pickpockets.  Now, where'd he go?" 
</p>
<p>
Not far, as it turns out; Precognition picks him up again lurking in a small tree streamer as I head west from the room he was in.  Hmm, now why can't I still see him&#8230; wait a minute, stupid, temporary see invisible doesn't mean temporary ESP for invisible creatures, you still can't see him if he isn't in line of sight. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/redface.png" alt=":o" height="15" width="15">  Okay, I'll just have to lure him out of the trees into the corridor and Pulverize him the old-fashioned way&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15">  He eventually drops his ring and a Spectral Scimitar (+5,+4).  That'll sell for a bit. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15"> Even better, a Novice priest a bit further in drops a Blessed Small Sword of *Slay Demon* (+3,+5) (+4). <img src="./wiki/classic/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> <img src="./wiki/classic/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15">  I'd better head back with these after I've finished the level. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking of which, not far from there, I catch the Tengu leaking out of the quest room.  I manage to kill one before the second teleports me away. 
</p>
<p>
"Wh&#8211;?  All right, now I'm annoyed." 
</p>
<p>
You think that's bad?  On the way back, one of the escaped Tengu teleports me straight into the quest room, where the remaining six bounce me around a few times. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, <em>that's</em> it!  Eat teek, jerks!" 
</p>
<p>
Would that it were so simple.  These Tengu are annoyingly tough, apparently taking several Pulverizes each to kill, during which time I'm getting bounced around the room and dropped on lava and getting scrolls burnt.  By the time I finish off another three, my mana's almost gone; I have to teleport out to rest up. 
</p>
<p>
"Man, that was embarrassing." 
</p>
<p>
Say, maybe we should swap in the Blessed Short Sword of *Slay Demon*; it has sense demon, so we can see the Tengu coming. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, that feels <em>much</em> better.  And you're right, it looks like we've got company." 
</p>
<p>
Indeed, one of the Tengu that teleported away earlier is nearby, lurking around in the trees.  I dispatch him quickly and return for round three. The remaining six Tengu leak out of the quest room after me as I approach, but with my newfound ability to track them, they aren't hard to dispatch. The quest reward choices are a Broad Sword, Gauntlets and a Pike; I've got plenty of saleable weapons for now, so I think I'll go with the Gauntlets. Oh, and in all the excitement, I didn't notice that the Tengu took me to <em>clvl&#160;14</em>; skill points go 1 to Mindcraft, 1 to Magic, and 3 to Weaponmastery. 
</p>
<p>
"Darn it, she got away before we could get back and watch her go." 
</p>
<p>
Don't worry, we'll have plenty more chances.  The Gauntlets turn out to be of Free Action [+3], exactly what I was hoping for.  And as promised, we recall immediately to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to sell off loot.  I think I'll keep the Blessed Small Sword of *Slay Demon* as my main weapon for now; it has +4 INT and WIS, which is useful for a Mindcrafter, plus resist fire and chaos, so I can sell off the Ring of Fire Resistance, and, as I discover when I *ID* it, <em>full telepathy</em>. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> <img src="./wiki/classic/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
"I knew I was picking up something from that sword.  Oh, yeah!  The Babe is Back!&#8482;" 
</p>
<p>
Indeed.  And now that we have Smeagol's ring, we can do the Mushroom quest. 
</p>
<p>
"Uh&#8230; nice doggie&#8230;  Man, if I had my teep back, I could just put the poor things to sleep or scare them away or something." 
</p>
<p>
Hmm, now that you mention it, we should try your Domination attack; it should scare them away without hurting them. 
</p>
<p>
"I'm game.  Okay, focus, and, <em>FEAR</em>&#8230; um, it's not working." 
</p>
<p>
Hmm&#8230; <em>[sound F/X:  source diving]</em>  Ah, never mind, uniques are immune to that effect. 
</p>
<p>
"Okay, now I feel inadequate&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
&#8216;Sokay, we can still sneak past them.  The quest nets, as always: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Sling of Farmer Maggot (+20,+0) (+2), which activates for terrify  every 10+d50 turns and has +2 searching, infravision and shots. 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
I think I'll wield it, just for giggles.  Next time out, we return to the Downs.

<strong>BDw 6</strong>, take 3; "What a boring place&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Indeed.  A 1x1 small level, and thus over quickly. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, this place wasn't so small last time we were here, was it?" 
</p>
<p>
Now, it's a different BDw 6 from the one where we killed Smeagol and those Tengu. 
</p>
<p>
"Same dungeon, same depth, different level?" 
</p>
<p>
Yep.  Dungeon levels in ToME aren't saved permanently like they are in some roguelike games; it'd take up way too much memory and disk space. 
</p>
<p>
"Weird place, this Arda&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
As you say.  Anyway, let's move on: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDw 7</strong>; "You like the look of this place&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
An arena level. 
</p>
<p>
"Ah, another one of these, huh?" 
</p>
<p>
Indeed.  I make my first successful test of Mind Wave. 
</p>
<p>
<em>[kicks Jackal corpse]</em> "Not bad, with the area effect and all, but it doesn't really pack the punch of my teek attack." 
</p>
<p>
It'll get stronger as you gain experience&#8212;and eventually it'll affect everything in line of sight. 
</p>
<p>
"Ah.  Cool." 
</p>
<p>
Of course, for this pack of Snotlings we just stumbled across, even lowly Neural Blast is enough&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  Further in, I find a room with a pack of Wolves clustered around a Hard Leather Cap; the Wolves push me to <em>clvl&#160;15</em>, and the Cap turns out to be Dwarven [+1] (+1). 
</p>
<p>
"So what did the Wolves want with this thing, anyway?" 
</p>

Nothing else of note on the level, except a small pack of Undead masses that managed to give me a CON hit. 
</p>
<p>
"Okay, that was even more disgusting than the deformed shrimp guy with the invisibility ring." 
</p>
<p>
Be glad I don't have CthAngband monsters turned on; there's some <em>really</em> disgusting stuff in there&#8230;  Anyway, let's move on: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDw 8</strong>:  Fumblefingers quest for 18 Dark elven priests; "You like the look of this place&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
"What, this guy again?" 
</p>
<p>
Yes, we'll be seeing him again fairly often.  You didn't say anything about the princess appearing again. 
</p>
<p>
"What, was that the same princess?  I never really got a good look at her, what with those teleporting demon things bouncing me all over the room like a fraggin' volleyball.  So what <em>is</em> the story here, then?" 
</p>
<p>
<em>(shrug)</em> No idea; I've pretty much given up trying to figure out the random quests.  Anyway, one of those Dark elven priests is in telepathy range as we enter the level&#8212;and here comes another one. 
</p>
<p>
"They're fast." 
</p>
<p>
Yes; shame you don't have Adrenaline Channeling yet.  With a bit of strategic ambushing, though, the first two fall in short order.  Hmm, looks like there are another three off to our west, along with Bullroarer, who just woke up. 
</p>
<p>
"&#8216;Bullroarer&#8217;?  Kind of an ambitious name for a hobbit, isn't it?" 
</p>
<p>
He is actually pretty tough.  We won't see him in action immediately, though; one of the Dark elven priests just got around the corner to me, and after three Mindcraft failures in a row, I <em>finally</em> manage to teleport to safety, with 21/91hp left. 
</p>
<p>
<em>*gasp*</em> <em>*wheeze*</em> "Okay, now I <em>really</em> feel inadequate." 
</p>
<p>
You understand, of course, this <em>cannot</em> go unanswered&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/angry.png" alt="X-(" height="15" width="15">  While resting up from that rout, I have to fend off a horde of Rotting corpses, who push me over the top to <em>clvl&#160;16</em>, with skill points going 1 to Mindcraft, 1 to Magic and 3 to Weaponmastery.  And Precognition just gained magic-mapping ability. 
</p>
<p>
"Weird&#8230; it's like telepathic sonar or something." 
</p>
<p>
Indeed.  Heading back to the scene of my previous embarrassment, I find a Rod Tip of Trap Location.  Man, why can't Trilogy find one of these? <img src="./wiki/classic/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15"> Ah, here's another Dark elven priest to take down, plus another one a bit further back which makes four so far&#8212;and there are the four clustered near Bullroarer.  I lure them out around another corner, and this time they fall quickly. 
</p>
<p>
"Yes!  Still got the touch." 
</p>
<p>
Well, we've got ten more of those guys to &#8216;touch&#8217;, and they don't appear to be anywhere nearby.  Ah, here's one further in, stuck behind this pack of Manes.  Which reminds me, I keep forgetting to pray to Tulkas while I'm killing evil monsters.  From there, we swing back and take on Bullroarer; two Pulverizes and he's down. 
</p>
<p>
"&#8216;Bullroarer,&#8217; huh?  I'm not impressed, short-stuff." 
</p>
<p>
Heh.  He drops a Light War Axe (+5,+2), a Cutlass (+4,+2), and a Pike (+4,+5)&#8212;and it took my last three ?oID's to find that out.  We'll probably have to back to Bree and restock after this level. 
</p>
<p>
"And get this dead guy's cap sterilized." 
</p>
<p>
Yes, yes&#8230;  The twelfth Dark elven priest pushes me over the top to <em>clvl&#160;17</em>, and Tulkas gives me the second relic quest, west of Bree and northwest of Minas Anor.  Hmm, that means the relic dungeon will be dlvls&#160;11&#8211;15, and the monsters will be leveled to level 22 at the top and 30 at the bottom.  <em>*shudder*</em> Definitely not until we've got Adrenaline Channeling, at the very least. 
</p>
<p>
"You keep going on about this Adrenaline Channeling thing.  What's it do?" 
</p>
<p>
You'll see.  As usual, I have to search the entire level to find the last Dark elven priest.  Quest reward choices are Magic-Device, Disarming, Summoning and Magic.  Hmm, there aren't any monsters Tulkas doesn't like me killing, so I don't need Summoning for a "handler" monster; I don't plan on disarming traps manually in the long term, and I can pump Magic-Device on my own time&#8230;especially if I pick Magic, which gives me three free points to reallocate in my skill plan. 
</p>
<p>
"A-<em>ha</em>!  I <em>knew</em> there was something fishy about that guy." 
</p>
<p>
What? 
</p>
<p>
"I was watching him in the reflection on my sword when he left.  He didn't just slip back into the shadows, he <em>vanished</em> into thin air." 
</p>
<p>
<em>(shrug)</em> Maybe he put on a Ring of Invisibility. 
</p>
<p>
"Maybe, but if he had one of those, why did he need me to get his sword back for him?  And I don't know what an invisibility ring looks like in action, but I have seen black-light camouflage suits in action, and they look <em>exactly</em> like what that guy just did." 
</p>
<p>
Could be, I dunno.  At any rate, I've changed my mind; I think we've got enough inventory space to push on to the end of the Downs before having to come back up to ID stuff.  Oh, I forgot to allocate the skill points from that last level gain:  with the recent boost to Magic, I can put 1 to Mindcraft and 4 to Weaponmastery.  Now, as I was saying, we push on to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDw 9</strong>; "What a boring place&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Ah, I just noticed that Pulverize is now radius-1.  I'll have to be careful about shattering potions now.  Otherwise, the level is as boring as advertised; fast-forward to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDw 10</strong>:  Princess quest for The Rat King; "You feel strangely lucky&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
A 1x3 small level, and the quest room is right on screen.  Before I can get there, though, a Hill orc Rogue pushes me over the top to <em>clvl&#160;18</em>, with skill points going 1 to Mindcraft and 4 to Weaponmastery.  Hmm, one more level before we get Adrenaline Channeling; I might go do a level of the Orc Cave before trying the relic quest. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeesh.  I hope it's as big as its advance billing makes it out to be." 
</p>
<p>
Whatever.  I do a quick sweep down to the south end of the level, and then come back to&#8230; um, Lisa, were Vort and her entourage here when we passed this way before? 
</p>
<p>
"No, I think I would've noticed that many kobolds." 
</p>
<p>
Quirk of the monster generation algorithm, I suppose.  Shall we, then? 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, I'm game." 
</p>
<p>
That's the spirit. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  The first wave is Small kobolds, which I can chop up with my sword to save mana&#8212;remembering this time to pray to Tulkas while I'm doing it.  Vort comes in behind them, and I let the Small kobolds get in a few measly hits while I hit Vort with three Pulverizes to take her down, also catching one of her Large kobold entourage directly behind her. The rest of the Large kobolds are behind her, and I use Pulverize to daze them long enough to chop them up with my sword. 
</p>
<p>
"So, we've got a queen of kobolds and a king of rats.  I don't suppose the icky things have any royalty?" 
</p>
<p>
The Icky Queen doesn't show up until later, actually. 
</p>
<p>
"I <em>knew</em> I shouldn't have asked&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Anyway, we have more mysterious monster appearances to deal with:  while we were cleanup up the loot from Vort's gang, a gang of Novice mindcrafters just materialized back where we were exploring the south end of the level. 
</p>
<p>
"Sheesh, where do these monsters keep coming from?" 
</p>
<p>
Beats me.  And the Rat King just burst out of the quest room.  He gets in a bite on me, poisoning me, and takes five Pulverizes to kill. 
</p>
<p>
"Well, <em>that</em> was certainly a rodent of unusual&#8211;" 
</p>
<p>
Just don't&#8230;  Quest reward choices are Arrows, a Basillard, or a Lead-Filled Mace; we'll want to stick with this weapon, I think, and the arrows will probably sell for more. 
</p>
<p>
"Darn, missed her again." 
</p>
<p>
Poor luck in quest room geometry, I suppose.  Anyway, with that done we return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
where we learn that Vort's drop was a War Hammer (+1,+4) and the quest reward was 30 Arrows of Slay Dragon (+2,+4).  The alchemy shop doesn't have any restore-CON potions, so I take a side trip to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gondolin</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to pick one up.  I also buy a Spellbook of Divine Aim from the temple and a Rod Tip of Illumination from the black market; fortunately, the magic shop has a Wooden Rod of Nothing to go with it.  Oh, and it appears I have an unchecked fate:  to find Narthanc on level 20. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
"What's Narthanc?" 
</p>
<p>
A magical dagger, potentially quite powerful.  Back in: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
I restock ?oID's and !oCCW's.  Hmm, I'm about halfway to the next clvl; I think I'll stick with my plan to do a level of the Orc Cave and then go do the relic quest. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, aren't you forgetting something?" <em>[points to top of head]</em> 
</p>
<p>
Oh, right.  Decado the Handsome looks at us funny, but he obligingly washes down the Dwarven Hard Leather Cap that those Wolves were manhandling. 
</p>
<p>
<em>(sniff)</em> "Well, that's got <em>most</em> of the smell off of it; I guess I can live with it now."

<p>
<strong>Orc 10</strong>; "What a boring place&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
It certainly lives up to its advertising at first.  I am somewhat concerned, though, about the number of Pulverizes we're having to throw around to take out even a relatively small pack of Cave orcs.  I may hold off on the relic quest until we've got Mind Wave up to line-of-sight levels. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, whatever.  This place doesn't look too hard, I'm all for hanging around here for a while." 
</p>
<p>
Heh.  Not far in, I kill Brodda, who drops a Quarterstaff (+4,+1).  Hmm, looks like we've got a Giant fruit fly infestation starting up in this next room. 
</p>
<p>
"No prob, I got it covered." <em>*WHUMP*</em> <em>*WHUMP*</em> 
</p>

Careful, don't overexert yourself. 
</p>
<p>
"Ah, come on, what's the worst that could&#8212;wait, something's wrong, it's slipping, <em>I can't control it!</em>" 
</p>
<p>
Ouch, the mind-storm side effect of Mindcraft failure.  It drains my mana and paralyzes me; by the time I recover, I'm surrounded by insects and down to 18/112hp and 11/111 mana.  Time to beat a hasty retreat, I think&#8230; Major Displacement drops me on the other side of the level, in a three-way corridor intersection. 
</p>
<p>
"Sheesh, no one is safe around you, are they?  You gonna get all your characters killed like this?" 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Shh, I think Lisa's coming around. 
</p>
<p>
"<em>*moan*</em> What happened?" 
</p>
<p>
You lost control of your powers.  That happens occasionally; you seem to have caught about the worst possible combination of side effects at the worst possible moment. 
</p>
<p>
"Figures.  I'm gonna just take a nap here for a bit, then&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
&#8216;Fraid not; we've got incoming.  I can already sense Rotting corpses approaching down the north corridor and Cave orcs approaching down the east corridor.  With your mana levels this low, we're going to have to depend on combat for a while.  I fire up Divine Aim and take on the Rotting corpses, who have already reached me. 
</p>
<p>
<em>*slash*</em> "Wow, down in one hit.  Maybe this Tulkas guy is good for something after all." 
</p>
<p>
Indeed.  Unfortunately, at Prayer level 8, Divine Aim doesn't last very long; by the time the Rotting corpses have been cleared out, I've had to go through two !oCCW's to stay unpoisoned.  By this time, though, I've got enough mana back to try taking down the Cave orcs with Neural Blast. Fortunately, with them all lined up in a straight corridor, Neural Blast's occasional beam effect works to maximum effect, and soon the orcs are down. 
</p>
<p>
"<em>*whew*</em> I take it back about this place being easy.  Can we go back to that Barrow Downs place for a while?" 
</p>
<p>
I think we should be okay for now.  Those orcs just got us to <em>clvl&#160;19</em>, with skill points going 1 to Mindcraft and 4 to Prayer. 
</p>
<p>
"So do I finally get to see what this Adrenaline Channeling thing does?" 
</p>
<p>
Sure, let's take it for a spin. 
</p>
<p>
<em>*whoosh*</em> "Gah... whoa!  It's like everything's moving slower." 
</p>
<p>
Actually, you're moving faster. 
</p>
<p>
"It's kinda like those synth-adrenal stims they used to use in some of the underground boxing tournaments on Mars Colony&#8212;jacks you up for a few minutes of serious fighting, but when it wears off, you just crash." 
</p>
<p>
Something like that, except that Adrenaline Channeling doesn't "crash"; it's 100% all-natural, no harmful side effects. 
</p>
<p>
"Okay, wait a minute, how does <em>this</em> qualify as a teep power?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, Neural Blast basically works by stimulating the pain receptors in the target's brain, right? 
</p>
<p>
"Actually, that's a serious oversimplification, but okay, we'll go with it." 
</p>
<p>
Similarly, Adrenaline Channeling works by stimulating the fight-or-flight response handlers in your own brain. 
</p>
<p>
<em>(shrug)</em> "Okay, so I can see where this would be useful in a fight.  So, we gonna go do the relic quest now?" 
</p>
<p>
Not yet; the failure rate on Adrenaline Channeling is still way too high, and it's only a few more clvls to the switchover point for Mind Wave; I think we'll hang here a bit longer. 
</p>
<p>
"Works for me." 
</p>
<p>
The Giant fruit fly room is a lost cause by the time I get back to it.  At the end of the level, though, I manage to regain most of the piety I spent on Divine Aim earlier by clearing out an Undead mass infestation.  Hmm, I'm getting a little low on !oCCW's, but I think I can survive another level or two: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 11</strong>; "What a boring place&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
I disagree; arena levels are rarely boring.  At least it's a 3x5 small level, which cuts down on the danger a bit.  A pack of Snotlings pushes me to <em>clvl&#160;20</em>, with skill points going 1 to Mindcraft, 1 to Magic and 3 to Prayer.  A quick sweep of the rest of the level reveals nothing of interest, so we move on to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 12</strong>; "You like the look of this place&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
I like its look a little better after I've cleared out the pack of War bears near my entry point.  After that, things go relatively smoothly; notable events include finding an Everburning Torch of Illumination, which will come in handy later on, and encountering Nar, who takes a <em>lot</em> of Pulverizes and some dancing around with Minor Displacement to kill.  Nar takes me over the top to <em>clvl&#160;21</em>, with skill points going 1 to Mindcraft and 4 to Prayer.  With Mindcraft at level 25, your Mind Wave should be much more powerful now; let's try it out on these Cave orcs at the north end of this cavern. 
</p>
<p>
"Enh, it better have gotten a <em>lot</em> more powerful, because I don't remember it doing much before.  Okay, here goes:  <em>PAIN</em>&#8230;  Whoa.  I agree, that <em>is</em> quite an improvement." 
</p>
<p>
As you say.  Mind Wave is going to be your workhorse attack against groups for some time.  Oh, and your Minor Displacement power just got improved, too; try it. 
</p>
<p>
"Okay&#8230;"  <em>*WHOOSH*</em> "Hey!  It's one of those vortex things.  Did I do that?" 
</p>
<p>
Yep.  And before you ask, no, you can't get home with this; the other end of the Void wormhole must be somewhere nearby on the level, but you can control where it's placed. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, but still, I can see where that would be useful for tactical stuff." 
</p>
<p>
It also means that we'll need to start carrying Phase Door scrolls for emergency short-range escape, since we can no longer do that with Minor Displacement.  In fact, we're mostly done with the level now; let's finish up quickly and return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Br</strong><tt>^H^H</tt><strong>Wilderness</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Oh, right, I keep forgetting that part.  Okay, from <em>here</em> we'll return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to sell off loot and restock.  We have to go to Gondolin, though, to find any Phase Door scrolls, not to mention a Potion of Restore Wisdom to undo the damage from that mind-storm effect.  The Gondolin black market also has a Ring of Damage (+13), which will hopefully be useful soon.  Back in Bree, the black market has a Sprig of Athelas in stock, which I buy to start my stockpile.  And from here I think I'm ready to try the relic quest next time out. 
</p>
<h4 id="head-81c062237414edef16446a929ab0ff8c82b55608">Second relic quest</h4>
<p>
And with some trepidation, I head out to find the second relic quest dungeon. 
</p>
<p>
"Trepidation?  Come on, the first one wasn't <em>that</em> bad." 
</p>
<p>
Relic quests get tougher <em>very</em> quickly as you go up in level, particularly Tulkas relic quests. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, Trilogy was telling me she had some major trouble with <a class="interwiki" title="Self" href="./DayInTheLifeArchive_2fTrilogy_2c_20the_20Half_2dElf_20Geomancer#head-81c062237414edef16446a929ab0ff8c82b55608"><img src="./wiki/classic/img/moin-inter.png" alt="[Self]" height="16" width="16">her second one</a>." 
</p>
<p>
Trilogy's misfortune was that her second relic quest dungeon started at dlvl&#160;8, and was thus primed to have both Mughash's and Vort's groups. Your relic quest dungeon starts at dlvl&#160;11, so you won't have that particular problem; but monsters in Tulkas quests are leveled more aggressively than in Eru quests, so they're likely to be <em>very</em> tough&#8212;almost twice as fast and probably more than twice as many hit points. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, I remember on, like, my second Manwe god dude quest, I nearly got my butt kicked by <em>mushrooms</em>.  That was seriously humiliating." 
</p>
<p>
"Ah, you must be the Bjorn guy Trilogy was telling me about." 
</p>
<p>
"The one and only, psychic babe." 
</p>
<p>
"Have you told him that surfboards haven't been invented in Arda yet?" 
</p>
<p>
I haven't had the heart&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/redface.png" alt=":o" height="15" width="15">  "West of Bree", in this case, leaves us with a quest dungeon not far to the northeast of the Sandworm Lair.  Here goes nothin', folks: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LTm 11</strong>, take 1; "You have a good feeling&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
No, I don't; there's an Owlbear two squares away from me, and I don't have my lamp wielded.  Fortunately, it doesn't move while I wield it; unfortunately, Mind Wave does only one star of damage to it, and it immediately moves right next to me.  A Phase Door scroll takes me to an adjacent room to the north, where the Owlbear (and the three Rotting corpses detected by Precognition that I didn't see at first) can't get to me for now.  <em>*whew*</em> This should give you some idea of what we're up against, Lisa. 
</p>
<p>
"Riiiight.  How does a girl check out of this chicken outfit again?  No, wait, never mind, I've got a plan." 
</p>
<p>
Lisa's plan is to form a Void wormhole from this room to a strategic location in the first room far away from where they're clustered trying to get to me, bounce back in and Pulverize them until they fall.  An excellent plan, and it works. 
</p>
<p>
"See?  We'll be fine, we've just got to be clever about it." 
</p>
<p>
Well, it's refreshing to have a character more optimistic than I am&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15">  We reuse this strategy frequently&#8212;perhaps a bit <em>too</em> frequently; the immediate vicinity is peppered with Void jumpgates. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, better part of discretion, right?" 
</p>
<p>
As you say. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  A group of Cave orcs takes me to <em>clvl&#160;22</em>, with skill points going 1 to Mindcraft and 4 to Weaponmastery.  About halfway in, we detect Wormtongue nearby.  He's in a room to the south of the one we're in, and he and all the other monsters in the room are awake by now, which allows me to employ a strategy I'm starting to really like:  lure all the monsters as far east as I can, then form a Void wormhole to the west side of the room and Mind Wave them as they approach, then jump back out to safety when then get too close. 
</p>
<p>
At least, that's how it was <em>supposed</em> to work&#8230;  Unfortunately, one of the monsters in the room was a Tengu, who promptly teleported me to him, off the critical jumpgate.  And even with Adrenaline Channeling active, Wormtongue manages to get off two stinking clouds in the same turn.  And to make things worse, another of the monsters is a Baby blue dragon, who starts breathing on me.  I hang around just long enough to pulverize the Tengu for good measure, then make a mad dash back to the jumpgate; by the time I escape, I'm down to 61/141hp. 
</p>
<p>
"Sheesh.  That'll teach me to get cocky&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
You and me both.  This time, when I jump back in, I Pulverize Wormtongue first to stun him, and keep Pulverizing him till he's dead; the rest of the monsters fall to Mind Wave. <em>*whew*</em>  Wormtongue's drops are a Broad Axe of Slay Demon (+6,+5) and a Beaked Axe of *Slay Dragon* (+9,+2) (+1). They're kind of heavy between them, though; I'll have to leave them in this room and remember to come back for them. 
</p>
<p>
"I can see this is gonna get old <em>real</em> quick&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
As you say.  I carry this trick through the entire level, finding no relic, so I head back to pick up Wormtongue's drop, picking up <em>clvl&#160;23</em> on the way from a pack of Blue icky things; skill points go 1 to Mindcraft and 4 to Weaponmastery.  We recall from there to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wilderness</strong> 
</p>
<p>
and return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to sell off our loot. 
</p>
<p>
"And we might have to do that <em>four</em> more times." 
</p>
<p>
Indeed.  The temple has a discounted Spellbook of Whirlwind, which I pick up for possible future use.  And with increasing trepidation, we recall back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LTm 11</strong>, take 2; "You feel strangely lucky&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
No, I don't; there's a Large kobold right next to me as I enter the level. <em>[examines Large kobold]</em> Hey, wait a minute, it's not leveled. <em>[examines other nearby monsters]</em> And neither is anything else.  Well, <em>this</em> will make my life easier, but I don't get it. 
</p>
<p>
"And &#8216;not leveled&#8217; means&#8230;?" 
</p>
<p>
That the monsters aren't any tougher here and now than in normal dungeons. 
</p>
<p>
"Hmm, I see what you mean; those Snotlings were pushovers.  This is a <em>lot</em> easier than last time we were here.  Why the difference?" 
</p>
<p>
<em>(shrug)</em> Bug in the dungeon generation code, I suppose.  At any rate, I'm not gonna complain.  Hang on, telepathy is picking up Orfax in a room to our south; I recommend your void-gate trick for him. 
</p>
<p>
"Way ahead of you."  <em>*WHOOSH*</em> 
</p>
<p>
That actually wasn't as necessary as I'd feared; Orfax falls quickly and drops a War Hammer (+1,+2).  A few rooms further north, Mughash and company fare just as poorly, and drop a Large Leather Shield [+1] and a Light War Axe (+3,+4). 
</p>
<p>
"Man, with all this luck, maybe the relic will be on this level too." 
</p>
<p>
No such luck, alas.  And don't count on having it as easy when we bounce back in via: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wil</strong><tt>^H^H^H</tt><strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Um&#8230; <em>(scratches head)</em> weren't the up stairs supposed to take me into the wilderness?  Oh well, I needed to restock anyway.  The Bree alchemy shop doesn't have any ?oID's, though, so I venture to Gondolin for those&#8212;and the black market there has a Potion of Experience that I can afford without quite breaking the bank.  We're close to the next clvl already, though, so I'll stow it back in Bree for now and return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LTm 11</strong>, take 3; "You like the look of this place&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Not really, considering that the monsters are back to leveling. Fortunately the level-22 Bandit to my south is in a parallel corridor and can't get to me easily.  That last level left me a bit careless, unfortunately; while I'm finishing off the Bandit, a Baby blue dragon slips in from the south and drops me to 78/148hp in a single breath.  I'm gonna need to get some elemental resistances pretty soon&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
It doesn't get any easier from there, alas.  I hit <em>clvl&#160;24</em> while luring monsters out of a four-subroom pit to my carefully placed void-gate ambush; skill points go 2 to Mindcraft and 3 to Magic.  Some Snotlings lure me out past the four-subroom pit before I finish exploring it, and by the time I get back, the room is infested with Undead masses and Gibbering mouthers.  Annoyingly, my Mindcraft skill is only level 28, which means Precognition doesn't yet detect objects&#8212;which means the relic might still be in there, in the parts I haven't yet looked at.  A few assaults on the growing hordes quickly prove fruitless, so I'm reduced to using carefully positioned Void gates and beating the masses back just far enough to get a look at the last bits of the room before moving on. 
</p>
<p>
An annoyingly tough pair of Owlbears pushes me up to <em>clvl&#160;25</em>, with skill points going 1 to Mindcraft, 1 to Magic and 3 to Weaponmastery. Fortunately, by this point I've got the level mostly covered, so it doesn't take much longer to finish off and return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wil</strong><tt>^H^H^H</tt><strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
And <em>again</em> the stairs drop me back in Bree.  <em>(shrug)</em> Hey, I'm not gonna complain&#8212;it saves me ?oWoR's. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  I think it's time to pull that Potion of Experience out of storage; it takes me to <em>clvl&#160;26</em>, with skill points going 1 to Mindcraft, 1 to Magic and 3 to Weaponmastery. This pushes Mindcraft up to skill level 30, which should make my job easier.  I have to go to Gondolin to *ID* a junkart I found this time in: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Crystal Ball of Godly Sights, which activates for cure fear 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Enh, not terribly useful; it sells for a bit of coin.  I stow my other prize from this trip, two Potions of Cure Light Insanity to start my stockpile, and restock in preparation to hopefully finish the quest next time out. 
</p>
<h4 id="head-5cee4dfbfff05705e264f8a06155eb2099810de1">Second relic quest (take 2)</h4>
<p>
With continuing trepidation, we recall back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LTm 11</strong>, take 4; "You like the look of this place&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Actually, this time I do:  there's a Scruffy-looking hobbit next to me as I enter the level, and he's not leveled.  Okay, I think this establishes a pattern. 
</p>
<p>
"What, if there's a monster next to you right off the bat, then the monsters won't be leveled? 
</p>
<p>
Hm?  Oh, yes, there was the Large kobold last time this happened; but that, I think, was just a coincidence.  No, both this time and the last time this happened occurred right after I saved and reloaded the game.  I'm not sure how that could lead to this effect, but as before, I'm not gonna complain about it&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15">  I just hope we find the relic on this level. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, no kidding.  Hey, I think my telepathic sonar thing is getting stronger; it's picking up stuff lying on the ground now. 
</p>
<p>
Yep, Precognition gained that power when I pushed Mindcraft up to 30.  At skill level 45, it'll map out and light the entire level&#8212;but I sincerely hope I've finished all the relic quests by then. 
</p>
<p>
With the monsters not leveled, the level proceeds fairly quickly, but doesn't net the relic.  It does, however, net Cord Armor of Resist Lightning and a Short Sword of *Slay Undead*, which will sell well after the stairs once again mysteriously return me to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
where I buy a Spellbook of Stone Skin from the book store for possible future use.  And now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to test my theory. <em>*click*</em> 
</p>
<p>
<em>[&#8230;]</em> 
</p>
<p>
<em>*click*</em> Okay, shall we try this again, Lisa? 
</p>
<p>
"Did&#8230; something just happen?" 
</p>
<p>
I saved and reloaded the game, to see if I could trigger the monster non-leveling effect again.  Shall we go see if it worked? 
</p>
<p>
"Go for it." 
</p>
<p>
Here we go, then: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LTm 11</strong>, take 5; "What a boring place&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
And it appears to have worked; the Dark elven mage nearby as I arrive is level 10.  Hmm, would it be dishonest, do you think, to exploit this apparent bug in the future? 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, if it improves my odds of getting home, I'm all for it." 
</p>
<p>
That goes without saying, I suppose&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
"Okay, this is the fifth time, so we know the relic has to be here, right?" 
</p>
<p>
Comparing notes with Trilogy again?  Yes, the relic is on this level, so keep an eye out for trap doors or monsters that can teleport us off the level. 
</p>
<p>
"What, can't we just come back for it if we miss it?" 
</p>
<p>
"Nope, &#8216;fraid not, psychic babe.  I remember this one time, on one of my Manwe god dude quests, we hit this trap door thing, and dude, like, <em>totally</em> freaked out and was all, &#8216;Aw, man, we blew it!&#8217;&#8212;but luckily the relic thing wasn't on that level, so we were okay." 
</p>
<p>
Actually, Bjorn, I remember that slightly differently:  it was an Imp that teleported us down to the next level, and I didn't immediately give up, I was just concerned that we <em>might</em> have failed the quest. 
</p>
<p>
"So, is he gonna keep popping in like this?" 
</p>
<p>
<em>(shrug)</em> I can never tell when someone's gonna pop in and do a cameo. I should probably introduce you to the rest of the team sometime, I suppose. 
</p>
<p>
"I'm not sure whether I should be frightened&#8230; hang on, I think I'm picking up the relic, off to our north." 
</p>
<p>
And indeed, after searching most of the level, I finally detect the relic in a room on the northern edge of the level&#8212;and there's a Tengu right next to it&#8230;  <em>[checks notes]</em> <em>*whew*</em> Good, Tengu don't have a teleport-level spell.  And Precognition isn't detecting any other monsters between us and the relic; a straight shot in and we're done. 
</p>
<p>
"Thank what's-his-name <em>that's</em> overwith.  Let's blow this joint." 
</p>
<p>
Indeed.  There are no stairs up nearby, so I splurge and use a ?oWoR to return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
where the black market has a cheap Potion of Charisma that jumps my CHA from 12 to 14. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
"So what now?  Back to that orc place?" 
</p>
<p>
Most likely. 
</p>
<h4 id="head-2d50666680edf9adb4da7d3d9322db788a0e5903">Orc 12 (take 2) thru Orc 18</h4>
<p>
This time out, back to the Orc Cave. 
</p>
<p>
"Okay, so we've lost our place in the Orc Cave now, right, what with recalling in and out of that quest place?  So now I suppose we have to start the orc place over from the beginning?" 
</p>
<p>
Actually, no, we can fix that by going cross-country to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 10</strong> 
</p>
<p>
and recalling back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wilderness</strong> 
</p>
<p>
which resets our recall target back to Orc&#160;12. 
</p>
<p>
"Ah.  That's handy." 
</p>
<p>
As you say.  We return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
where, just for giggles, I buy a Brass Lantern of Illumination from the black market, allowing me to stow the Rod of Illumination I'd been carrying to this point.  And from here we recall to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 12</strong>, take 2; "You like the look of this place&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Mostly uneventful, beyond giving me a chance to try out my new illuminate power.  Fast-forward to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 13</strong>; "You feel your luck is turning&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Again, nothing of particular interest, except for an interesting geographical oddity:  a mid-sized cavern near the entry cavern that is completely unconnected from the rest of the dungeon.  A quick Minor Displacement void gate, on the other hand, gets us right in. 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like the connecting corridor caved in.  These poor Cave orcs must have been trapped here for days.  Guess I should put &#8216;em out of their misery, huh?" <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
Indeed.  Let's move on, then: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 14</strong>; "This level can't be all bad&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
A pack of Black orcs is right next to me as I enter the level; two turns later, of course, they're nowhere to be found&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15">  Beyond that, not much of interest. 
</p>
<p>
"So this is the &#8216;no pain, no gain&#8217; part, right?" 
</p>
<p>
Hm? 
</p>
<p>
"I assume this is all supposed to be training, making me stronger so I'll be ready when I eventually have to face this Morgoth guy." 
</p>
<p>
Ah, yes, as you say.  It's fairly early yet, though; you've still got lots more training to do. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, I kinda expected that&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
That's the spirit. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  Hmm, my pack is getting kinda heavy; I think we'll go maybe one more level before heading back up: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 15</strong>; "You hear the sound of a market." 
</p>
<p>
And a good thing we did. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15">  The dungeon town has a Scribe, a Recaller, a Footwear Shop, a Common Shop, and four copies of a Library.  The Scribe nets some identify scrolls to ID the <tt>{excellent}</tt> stuff I've accumulated so far, as well as a Scroll of *Identify* to ID: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Gem of Fire, which activates for decreasing INT 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Joy.  The Footwear Shop is more interesting, as it has: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Soft Leather Boots of Umarri [+9], with sustain CON and resist  poison, shards and disenchantment 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
And it's even in my price range&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15">  And now my pack really is too heavy, so I recall to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to sell off loot before returning to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 15</strong>, take 2; "You hear the sound of a market." 
</p>
<p>
The stores haven't had time to roll, of course, so they've still got the same stuff I've already leafed through.  I do find my first Potion of Healing, though, with which I can start my stockpile.  In the near term, though, we push on to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 16</strong>; "You have a good feeling&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Well, no, considering this is the first level feeling I've seen in a while beyond the wimpy stuff, I'm not feeling terribly good right now&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"Jeez, are you always this optimistic?" 
</p>
<p>
Long and bitter experience.  Oh, and sarcasm doesn't become you. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> A mixed pack of Ogrillons and Rotting corpses put me over the top to <em>clvl&#160;27</em>, with skill points going 1 to Mindcraft, 1 to Magic and 3 to Weaponmastery.  Hmm, I notice Divine Aim is up to spell effect level 22; why don't we try it out on this next pack of Rotting corpses? 
</p>
<p>
"Man, you really <em>are</em> trying to turn me into a sword-swinging bar brawler, aren't you?" 
</p>
<p>
<em>(shrug)</em> Well, you <em>are</em> going to have to fight a fair amount in the late game; nothing wrong with getting in some practice now.  No pain, no gain, as you said. 
</p>
<p>
"And this would be the pain part?" 
</p>
<p>
Ah yes, that:  Divine Aim lasts me through the Rotting corpses and some Black orcs, but while I'm fighting off the latter, some Phantom warriors gang up on me and take me down to 77/171hp before I can get back into the mountain-lined corridor where they can't double up on me. 
</p>
<p>
Further in, I run into Ufthak hanging with a pack of Cave orcs.  He's in one of those large cavern types with lots of internal walls dividing the cavern into small regions.  That could mean close-quarters fighting, and I don't think I want to try hand-to-hand with Ufthak just yet. 
</p>
<p>
"I wholeheartedly endorse that strategy." 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> Instead, after Mind Waving most of his entourage, I fire up Adrenaline Channeling, lure him around a corner, and Pulverize him to death.  He drops Cord Armor [+5].  Enh. 
</p>
<p>
And after bad encounters with some Killer bees and Flying skulls this level, my STR is down to&#160;12 and I can barely carry the minimal amount of loot I've collected so far.  Time to head back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
and get that fixed.  And I just noticed that my piety is over 5000, which means I'm getting a +1 CON boost from Tulkas. 
</p>
<p>
"Well, that's awfully nice of him.  Think he can spare me a PPG or something?" 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> Hmm, I think I have room for one more push this time out: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 16</strong>, take 2; "This level can't be all bad&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Oh, yes it can; it's one of those infamous 1x1 small levels with a single tiny cavern housing me and <em>all</em> the monsters.  What's really got me worried isn't the Paladin right next to me on my west, it's the Umber hulk immediately behind him. 
</p>
<p>
"Uh, a little help here?" 
</p>
<p>
Okay, I'm gonna take a slight tactical risk and fire up Adrenaline Channeling first to give us a bit of an edge.  After the first Mind Wave, the Paladin steps around me to the south&#8212;and the Umber hulk, now right next to me, turns out to be immune&#8230;  Let's try another tactical risk:  I cast Telekinetic Wave. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa!  Hey, that's handy; kind of a burst of random teek shoving stuff around." 
</p>
<p>
More importantly, it dropped the Umber hulk several squares away from me, whence it can be Pulverized in a single shot.  Don't get too used to it yet, though, its fail rate is still kind of high.  The rest of the level, of course, goes quickly, and we fast-forward to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 17</strong>; "What a boring place&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Okay, I think the RNG is toying with me now, as I enter <em>another</em> 1x1 single-room level.  At least this time I land in a reasonably spacious 20x5 rectangular room, and the obligatory Umber hulk is several squares away from me, allowing me to sweep the room satisfyingly quickly with a Mind Wave and a few Pulverizes. 
</p>
<p>
"So this is, what, the express route to the bottom or something?" 
</p>
<p>
I certainly hope not.  Let's find out: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 18</strong>; "You have a very good feeling&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Well, I certainly feel pretty good that this is finally another full-sized level.  I don't feel particularly good about my first encounter; a pack of Light hounds and Forest trolls drives me back into the corridors to recover my mana. 
</p>
<p>
"So, not gonna fight your way through that one, huh?" 
</p>
<p>
Enh, I didn't like the odds.  I try a different angle on the second approach, letting them leak out to me a few at a time, and using Psychic Drain to keep my mana up. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa, I can suck power out of monsters?  Cool!  Wait, why didn't we just do this last time?" 
</p>
<p>
I tried it on the Light hounds last time, but it didn't seem to work. Works fine on the trolls, though.  Not much further in, I run into Ulfast, who falls satisfyingly quickly and drops Metal Scale Mail [+2]. 
</p>
<p>
It isn't until the end of the level that I find out what the 'very good' feeling was about:  a lesser vault ('not' 'and') with a bunch of Ogrillons and Novice warriors on it.  Hmm, we prob'ly can't dig through the walls with my once-again weakened STR; let's void-hop in&#8230; no, it seems that Minor Displacement can't put a void gate inside a vault.  Fortunately, there's already a void wormhole leading in; now I just have to find the other end of it&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
Ah, here it is.  I fire up Adrenaline Channeling and dive in.  The fight is fairly straightforward, mostly Mind Waves with a few Psychic Drains to keep my mana up&#8212;I think I could get used to this strategy&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15">  The vault nets a Dwarven Lantern of the Eternal Eye and a few <tt>{excellent}</tt> items that I can't identify, having run out of Identify scrolls.  This Lantern could be <em>very</em> handy, though; I've been sorely missing see invisible.  In fact, I think I'll return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to pick up my Rod of Illumination.  Hmm, one of the things I picked up from that vault was a Dagger of Extra Attacks (+2,+3) (+1), which would do almost twice as much damage as the Blessed Small Sword of *Slay Demon* I'm currently wielding; but the +4 bonus to INT and WIS would be a lot to give up&#8230; enh, I think I'll stow the dagger for later.  I also ID: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Gem of Wisdom, which activates for cure confusion 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Enh.  I think this is a good place to leave it until next time out. 
</p>
<p>
<a id="latestdump" <h4 id="head-5a3a4fb766c0938c59888b3d11eb6b780c3eab27">Orc 18 (take 2) thru Orc 22</h4>

</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 18</strong>, take 2; "You like the look of this place&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Nothing of interest.  Clearly I've been away from this character too long; I keep forgetting to start praying to Tulkas before Mind-Waving large crowds of orcs and trolls.  Let's see if I can do better about that on: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 19</strong>; "You like the look of this place&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Not too far in, I run into Gorbag and company.  With Mind Wave this is almost too easy&#8230;  Gorbag drops Hard Leather Armor [+5] and a Fiery Small Wooden Boomerang (+12,+6). 
</p>
<p>
"Ooh, the good equipment.  He must have been one of the higher-ranking flunkies." 
</p>
<p>
Indeed.  In the next room over, a pack of Novice rangers drops a Shocking Scimitar (+6,+5).  And in a sign that I <em>really</em> need to do something about trap disarming in the not-too-distant future, I find a Small wooden chest with a Trap of Calling Out&#8212;as I discover the first dozen or so times I unsuccessfully fail to disarm it. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/redface.png" alt=":o" height="15" width="15">  I manage to suck in an entire pack of Energy hounds one at a time, and get started on a pack of Black ogres, before I finally disarm it&#8212;and net a whole 169gp for my efforts&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/angry.png" alt="X-(" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
We're fairly close to the end of the level when this happens, and in the very last cavern I find the Black ogres whose Archer I had inadvertently Called Out.  His now-departed brethren push me over the top to <em>clvl&#160;28</em>, with skill points going 1 to Mindcraft, 1 to Magic, 2 to Weaponmastery and 1 to Prayer. 
</p>
<p>
And that's it for this level; let's move on: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 20</strong>; "You feel you will meet your fate here.  You feel your luck is turning&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
I feel I want to know what that fate was&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  <em>[checks notes]</em> Ah yes:  to find Narthanc on dlvl&#160;20.  Say, my luck really <em>is</em> turning. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
"Is this it, here on the outer edge of the room?" 
</p>
<p>
<em>[reads ?oID]</em> Indeed it is. 
</p>
<p>
"Enh.  I'm not impressed, frank&#8211;" <em>[squints at Narthanc]</em> "Whoa&#8230; if I didn't know better, I'd almost think this thing is&#8230; <em>alive</em>." 
</p>
<p>
It is, sort of.  It's a sentient weapon; it gains experience and becomes more powerful as it kills monsters, just as you do. 
</p>
<p>
"Cool.  How powerful does it get?" 
</p>
<p>
That's a matter of luck, mostly.  And in the near term it probably won't gain experience very quickly, since we're going to be killing most monsters with Mind Wave anyway. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, you actually have to kill it <em>with</em> the dagger for it to count." 
</p>
<p>
Yes. 
</p>
<p>
"That's almost creepy.  You sure this isn't some kind of ritualistic cult thing that's gonna turn evil and summon some great big hideous demon, like in the old horror vids?" 
</p>
<p>
Don't worry, the great big hideous demons don't show up till much later. 
</p>
<p>
"I <em>knew</em> I shouldn't have asked&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> Wielding Narthanc would lose me the +4 WIS from my Blessed Small Sword of *Slay Demon*, which in turn costs me 14 mana and a percent or two on my Mindcraft fail rates; I think I can deal with that for now.  And in short order, Narthanc is level&#160;4, after I soften up a pack of Elite uruks to one star each with them Mind Wave and finish them off with Narthanc.  Gotta be a bit more careful doing that, though; I'm down to 108/182hp by the time I get them all. 
</p>
<p>
"Um, yes please?  Careful is good." 
</p>
<p>
By the time we finish the level, Narthanc has gained the Cold realm and two powers therefrom.  And my loot is getting kinda heavy, giving me the perfect excuse to return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to see what we've got: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Dagger 'Narthanc' (E:549, L:8) (+10,+8), which is sentient,  activates for fire bolt (9d8) every 8+d8 turns, and has radius-1 light,  fire brand, slay demon, resist fire, and slow digestion 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
"That's <em>it</em>?  Am I supposed to be impressed?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, it didn't have slay demon or slow digestion when you found it.  For that matter, when you found it, it was only (+4,+6).  And that's just at level&#160;8; it can go as high as level&#160;50. 
</p>
<p>
"Mm.  Okay, we'll see where this goes." 
</p>
<p>
That's the spirit. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  Let's try and heat it up some more back on: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 20</strong>, take 2; "What a boring place&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
It is indeed mostly boring, with only a few points of interest&#8212;like the Small steel chest with the Gravity Ball Trap that takes me down to 28/182hp in a single stroke. 
</p>
<p>
<em>*wheeze*</em> "Can we not do that again, please?" 
</p>
<p>
Yes, we do need to find a Rod of Disarming or something.  And yes, I hear you lurking around back there, Gathraka, and I don't want to hear it. 
</p>
<p>
"Hmph.  Suit yourself, Human.  Keep an eye on him, girl." 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, no kidding." 
</p>
<p>
I tell ya, I get no respect around here&#8230;  Anyway, Narthanc by this point is level&#160;11 and has gained invisibility and access to the Poison realm. 
</p>
<p>
"Now, <em>this</em> is cool.  Can't hit ya if they can't see ya, right?" 
</p>
<p>
Actually, that's another annoying quirk of the code:  monsters with ranged attacks seem to be able to target you perfectly, even if they can't see you.  That's not as bad in our case, though, since we can attack them back just as easily, but still&#8230;  Anyway, let's move on: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Deathwatch</strong>; "This level looks filled with evilness." 
</p>
<p>
<em>*sniff sniff*</em> "Eugh!  What <em>is</em> that smell?" 
</p>
<p>
Looks like we've found an orc barracks.  And they tend not to be terribly fastidious, being orcs and all. 
</p>
<p>
"Yuck, I don't even want to think about it.  Remind me to sterilize my boots next time we're in town.  Wait, if this is a barracks, that probably means this is where their best-trained warriors are, right?  This could be bad&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Actually, Lisa, I don't think you'll have any trouble on this level. 
</p>
<p>
"If you say so.  Remember, I've got my eye on you." 
</p>
<p>
<em>[slaps forehead]</em> You see what I have to put up with&#8230;  And as I predicted, between Mind Wave and invisibility from Narthanc, the level isn't even a bit of challenge.  I take the the opportunity to train Narthanc up to level&#160;12, but it doesn't gain a power. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/sad.png" alt=":(" height="15" width="15">  The drops from the captains are even a cut above average:  a Dagger (Defender) from Lagduf and a Double Ring Mail of Resist Cold from Golfimbul.  Between that and some other loot I picked up on the previous level, though, I'm getting kind of weighted down, so I recall back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
For completeness, I swing over to Gondolin to *ID* the Deathwatch loot: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Leather Scale Mail 'Thalkettoth' [+25] (+3), with +3 DEX and speed  and resist acid and nexus 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Leather Gloves 'Cammithrim' [+10], which activate for magic missile  every 2 turns and have radius-1 light, sustain CON, free action and resist  light 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Main Gauche of Maedhros (2d5) (+12,+15) (+3), with +3 INT, DEX and  speed, slay troll and giant, free action, levitation and see invisible 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Also among my loot is Elven Hard Leather Armor [+13] with resist dark. It's annoyingly heavy, though, and I've already got resist fire and lightning covered, and Thalkettoth will cover resist acid&#8212;plus the speed boost never hurts&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  Cammithrim's a strict superset of my Gauntlets of Free Action, so that's a no-brainer.  As for Maedhros&#8230; I think I'll stick with Narthanc for now, but Maedhros will be a useful swap-in if Narthanc gains any annoying powers. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa, hold on, what kind of &#8216;annoying powers&#8217; are we talking about here?" 
</p>
<p>
<em>(shrug)</em> There are a few flags Narthanc could gain that would be mildly unpleasant, like earthquakes or drain-experience or chaotic effects. That's pretty unlikely, though. 
</p>
<p>
"&#8216;<em>Pretty</em>&#8217; unlikely.  Right.  I'm still waiting for the great big hideous demon to pop out of it, frankly." 
</p>
<p>
Uh-huh&#8230;  Gondolin's black market has a Potion of Wisdom in stock, which jumps my WIS from 18/30 to&#160;18/52.  Back in Bree, I splurge and buy a Potion of Experience from the black market, which takes me to <em>clvl&#160;29</em>&#8212;and nets me the third relic quest, southwest of Bree and northwest of Minas Anor. 
</p>
<p>
"I was wondering where he'd wandered off to.  Ooh, I don't like that look on your face&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
This relic quest is going to be a tough one; even on the top level, the monsters will be leveled to level&#160;38. 
</p>
<p>
"And&#8230; what level were the monsters in our last quest leveled to?" 
</p>
<p>
Level&#160;22. 
</p>
<p>
"Ow, that can't be good." 
</p>
<p>
No, it can't; we'll <em>definitely</em> be putting that one off for a while. Oh, I almost forgot to allocate my skill points for this level:  1 to Mindcraft, 1 to Magic, 2 to Weaponmastery, and 1 to Combat.  And with that done, we return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 21</strong>, take 2; "You feel your luck is turning&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
"Okay, wait a minute, where'd the barracks go?" 
</p>
<p>
This is presumably a different section of the level.  You've seen this happen before, remember? 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, and I still think it's screwy." 
</p>
<p>
Ah well&#8230;  The level turns out to be a 3x1 small level, with no significant challenges, but a bit of nice loot:  a Metal Cap of Seeing [+4] and not one but two Potions of Charisma.  That cap has potential as a swap-in, especially if it has telepathy.  And somewhere in the level, Narthanc hits level&#160;13 and gains frost brand. 
</p>
<p>
"Cool." 
</p>
<p>
I knew you were going to say that&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15">  Finally, then, we move on to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 22</strong>; "You like the look of this place&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
"&#8216;Finally&#8217;?" 
</p>
<p>
This is the last level of the Orc Cave; we'll face Azog here. 
</p>
<p>
"Azog?" 
</p>
<p>
King of the Uruk-hai.  That's him, to our northeast, stuck at a corner in another corridor trying to get to us. 
</p>
<p>
<em>(squints northeast)</em> "Got him.  Mm, he looks pretty nasty&#8212;and <em>definitely</em> pissed.  Guess he heard how I plowed through his barracks without even breaking a sweat&#8230;" <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
Watch the cockiness there, Azog is no pushover; he's almost twice as fast as you are. 
</p>
<p>
"That's what your vaunted Adrenaline Channeling is for, right?" 
</p>
<p>
Dear gods, I think I've created a monster&#8230;  From our angle of approach, Azog is pinned behind a sleeping Large kobold; we fire up Adrenaline Channeling and start Pulverizing.  With Psychic Drain to recharge with, we don't have to worry about running out of mana, either. About a dozen or so shots is enough to take Azog out. 
</p>
<p>
"There, see?  No problem." 
</p>
<p>
<em>*groan*</em> Besides Thrain's wand, Azog drops a Dark Sword (+5,+4), a Spear (+4,+2), and Chain Mail of Resist Cold [+9]. 
</p>
<p>
The rest of the level is fairly straightforward, netting another Potion of Wisdom.  A pack of Snagas and Earth hounds takes me to <em>clvl&#160;30</em> and Narthanc to level&#160;14; Narthanc gains poison brand, and I allocate skill points 1 to Mindcraft, 1 to Magic, 1 to Weaponmastery and 2 to Combat.  One final point of minor interest at the very end of the level is another isolated cavern with no corridors connected to it.  Nothing my Minor Displacement void tunnels can't handle, of course; nothing there really worth seeing, though.  What say we blow this joint? 
</p>
<p>
"Works for me" 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Darn, the Metal Cap of Seeing doesn't have telepathy.  This junkart looks useful, though: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Gem of Ice, which activates for restore stats and life levels every  750 turns 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
A bit of inventory juggling next:  with the cap of Seeing replacing the Dwarven cap, I no longer need the Dwarven Lantern of the Eternal Eye for its resist blindness or see invisible, so I swap back in the Everburning Torch of Illumination and stow the Rod of Illumination, picking up a Ring of Fire Resistance to cover the resistance hole left from the Dwarven cap. <em>*gasp*</em> Say <em>that</em> five times fast&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"That, that, that, that, that." <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
<em>*groan*</em>  Hmm, the black market has a Potion of Enlightenment in stock; I should start stockpiling these for the relic quest. 
</p>
<p>
"So we're gonna go find that relic thing next?" 
</p>
<p>
No, I don't think we're strong enough for that yet.  We'll probably do some of Mirkwood next. 
</p>
<p>
