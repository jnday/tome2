<em>Well, not copied per se; this is my original write-up of the Parallel Bjorn DitL, from which I cut-n-pasted to post on the Forum.  As with my other DitLs, all I've done is fix the occasional glaringly obvious mistake and translate the markup from phpBB to Wiki.  [The hardest part of that last, BTW, was the smileys, as there is substantial non-overlap of smiley coverage between the two domains; if any or all of the smileys seem inappropriate for their context&#8230; well, that's why.  We Apologize for the Confusion.&#8482;] -- <a href="./ZizzoTheInfinite">ZizzoTheInfinite</a></em> <hr>
 <p>
Okay, I think I've got enough material now to make a start on: 
</p>
<h2 id="head-e0b573103c91c9dfb0a0ab5b6df45ad9e1751698">The Bogus Journies of Parallel Bjorn</h2>
<p>
As you probably don't recall from my <a class="external" href=".www.t-o-m-e.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4612"><img src="./wiki/classic/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">original Bjorn DitL</a>, <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> I had an <a class="external" href="./www.killerbunnies.org/angband/ladder/bear/bear_1.html"><img src="./wiki/classic/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">earlier Bjorn</a> that I retired so I could start the DitL Bjorn from the beginning.  With the <a class="external" href="./www.killerbunnies.org/angband/ladder/bear/bear_2.html"><img src="./wiki/classic/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">demise of that Bjorn</a>, I brought the original out of retirement to see how far I could get with him before upgrading to 2.2.7 (since with that version's changes to bear form, the whole Beorning Warper strategy becomes redundant). 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, &#8216;cause Eru forbid you should play any of your <em>existing</em> characters once in a while.  I mean, it's not like I've been sitting down here doing nothing for&#8230; <em>[checks notes]</em> going on <em>three months</em> or anything." 
</p>
<p>
Yes, <a class="external" href="./www.killerbunnies.org/angband/ladder/gath/gath_2.html"><img src="./wiki/classic/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">Gathraka</a>, I know you're anxious to move on to the Spiders quest, but I need to finish writing up your backstory first, or no one will understand <em>why</em> you're doing the quest. 
</p>
<p>
"So?  Who cares if they understand?" 
</p>
<p>
<em>I</em> do.  It's a matter of artistic pride. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, great.  So I'm stuck down here cooling my heels in Elf town while Monsieur Artiste is up there waiting to achieve enlightenment.  <em>grmbl mutter lul kok-ishi&#8230;</em> 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15"> You see what I have to put up with.  Anyway, now that I've gotten this Bjorn to the same depth as his predecessor, I've decided to try resuming the story at this point with the new/old Bjorn&#8212;a sort of non-continuation continuation, if you will. 
</p>
<p>
And so, once again, I give you Bjorn, the Beorning Warper.  Say hello to the nice people, Bjorn. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, dudes and&#8212;whoa, <em>déjà vu</em>! Do I know these people, dude?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, yes and no.  This is the audience from the original Bjorn DitL, and since you're sort of taking over for him, you inherit the audience.  I don't plan to be too careful about thematic overlap between the two DitLs, which would probably explain your picking up stray memories from the original. 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15"> "Dude, have you been sneaking mushrooms from that hobbit farmer guy's field?" 
</p>
<p>
&#8230;Excuse me?" 
</p>
<p>
"&#8216;Coz if you've been bogarting those mushrooms, that is, like, totally not cool, dude." 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15"> Never mind, it'll make more sense as we go along&#8212;I hope. Anyway, we'll start with an executive summary of pertinent differences between this Bjorn (as seen here in the <a class="external" href="./www.killerbunnies.org/angband/ladder/bear/bear_3.html"><img src="./wiki/classic/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">updated dump</a>) and the original DitL Bjorn: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 This Bjorn is clvl 39 and has slightly better hit points.  His current  skill point arrangement is also somewhat different; for reasons noted  below, he held off on pumping Spell-power to get Divination and Conveyance  topped off according to the original skill-point plan (as described in the  original DitL). 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 This Bjorn has not done the Old Forest&#8212;it turned out to be  unnecessary, as he lucked out with some dungeon towns in Moria, including  one with a Forbidden Library. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 As a result of the preceding, this Bjorn has had <em>much</em> better  luck with Tomes, including the combined holy grail for a Warper (at least  for this one), Tomes of Knowledge and Translocation.  This prompted me to  do the Old Mage quest in Lothlorien to fireproof them (which I recorded as a  <a class="external" href="./www.killerbunnies.org/angband/ladder/cmov/cmov2.html"><img src="./wiki/classic/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">cmovie</a>  just for variety's sake); I've got one book's worth of fireproofing left. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 On the flip side, this Bjorn hasn't yet encountered any Nazgul.  He  has, however, learned that Nazgul aren't the only monsters that can give  you Black Breath, when a Vampire lord infected him on dlvl MoM 41.  I  hadn't been stockpiling Athelas, assuming I wouldn't need it, so we had to  make a run for Gondolin for some herbal healing. 
</p>
<p>
 "Yeah, that was totally heinous, dude." 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 This Bjorn has had better luck with getting relic quests early; he's  completed four, and has a fifth pending. 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Not much else of note to this point; there were doubtless some interesting adventures in there, but my non-DitL notes are rather terse.  Let's get this story re-started, then: 
</p>
<h3 id="head-dbe049f6cc1196199e6f63c3094377c1185b92ef">CHAPTER 6, redux</h3>
<h4 id="head-50199506ffa5a9311e5d01c13576464e7a5a2a70">Part 1 of 2</h4>
<p>
We join Bjorn as he's entering: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>MoM 47</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  This will be a fateful level. 
</p>
<p>
"What?  That nice Elf lady didn't say I was gonna, like, die here or something, did she?" 
</p>
<p>
No, but this <em>is</em> the level on which your parallel counterpart died; if you survive it, you will have surpassed him. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, that again.  Whatever.  Whoa, lots of Ogres.  Halt, you evildoers!" 
</p>
<p>
Some things don't change&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  We enter in a two-wide section of corridor, and as Bjorn says, we're surrounded by Ogres; one Noxious Cloud, however, takes down the lot of &#8216;em. 
</p>
<p>
Moving west from there, I encounter a pack of Araneas at the far side of the room I just entered, with an Ancient blue dragon smack in the middle of &#8216;em.  Fortunately, they don't wake up as I back out&#8230; <em>*whew*</em> 
</p>
<p>
"Man, I hate these things.  One time this kung-fu guy, like, summoned up a whole bunch of them around me, and they almost killed me with their spell things before I&#8230; wait, that's not right&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
No, that happened to the other Bjorn.  You're picking up his stray memories. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa." <em>(scratches head)</em>  "Guess you weren't bogarting those mushrooms after all.  Sorry, dude.  But next time, stop me after two, &#8216;kay?" 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  We, and the room the Araneas are in, are on the northern edge of the level, so we'll need to back up and loop south and west for a better approach.  The level seems to be annoyingly laid out, though; I may have to go around my proverbial elbow to get back to those Araneas.  My stealth seems to be improving, though, as I sneak up to a sleeping Ancient bronze dragon&#8212;and it wakes up just as I get next to it and Essence of Speed expires&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15"> No matter, though, he still dies satisfyingly quickly. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
Continuing the approach west through some Cave trolls and a flock of young and mature dragons (who drop a Potion of Charisma) finally brings me back to the Araneas from the southwest&#8212;but this puts me in the northwest corner of the level, and there appears to be no entrance from this angle. Well, they do seem to be awake now; maybe I can go back to the east approach and lure them out&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
Mm, no, the east approach is down a long stretch of corridor, which they won't follow me into, and the nearest room I could lure them into is too far away for them to see me; I'd have to dive into the room and brazen out the whole pack.  Hmm, I think there was a side room on the west approach that I couldn't get to; maybe if I could Phase Door into that&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"Uh, dude, do we actually, like, <em>need</em> to kill the spiders?" 
</p>
<p>
&#8230;You know, you're right.  That kind of reckless heroics is exactly what got your counterpart killed.  Leave &#8216;em be. 
</p>
<p>
The rest of the level proceeds with little incident.  A Dark elven sorcer drops a Potion of Dexterity, taking me from 18/75 DEX to 18/81.  Nearby, a pack of Black orcs drops: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Dagger 'Edilme' (+6,+10) (+3), with radius-1 light, +3 INT, frost  and lightning brand, chaotic effects, vampiric effects, and slay dragon and  evil 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Enh; it'll sell for a bit.  Finally, near the end of the level, in a four-subroom pit, I kill my first Undead beholder with this character. Normally, I avoid these guys like the plague, because they're annoyingly tough and have really annoying attacks, include a drain-charges attack; with my artifact wand, though, I threw caution to the proverbial wind and it fell in three turns. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15">  Oh, I also pick up a Potion of Resistance, with an eye toward starting a stockpile. 
</p>
<p>
"What do we need a potion for?  That's, like, what this stupid bulky armor is for, isn't it?" 
</p>
<p>
I'm planning ahead; we'll need them when we hit the bottom of Moria. 
</p>
<p>
"Why?" 
</p>
<p>
You'll see.  And that's the level; onward to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>MoM 48</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  Well, we did it. 
</p>
<p>
"What?  That wasn't so hard a level.  Oh, you're talking about your perpendicular-me thing again." 
</p>
<p>
Parallel.  Never mind, let's see what's so superb about this level. Certainly nothing nearby&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
Nothing much of interest happens for a while.  A Monastic lich drops a Potion of Charisma; in bear form, I can't tell whether I'm maxed in CHA or not, but I drink it anyway. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  Further in, an Ethereal dragon pushes me over the top to <em>clvl 40</em>, with skill points going 1 to Bearform-combat, 1 to Temporal and 3 to Spell-power.  Essence of Speed is up to spell effect level 46, but my unhasted speed in bear form drops to -13, so my top speed drops to +24.  And now that bear form has just expired, I can see that my CHA is in fact maxed. 
</p>
<p>
And with the acquisition of Caspanion from a pack of Algroths and The Lochaber Axe of the Dwarves from an AMHD, my pack is starting to get overfull.  I recall to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
where I *ID*: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Augmented Chain Mail of Caspanion [+20] (+3), which activates for  destroy doors and traps every 10 turns and has +3 INT, WIS and CON and  resist acid, poison and disenchantment 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Main Gauche of Azaghal (2d5) (+12,+14), with slay Xdragon, immunity  to fire, resist fear, and sense dragon 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Lochaber Axe of the Dwarves (+12,+17) (+10), with +10 searching,  infravision and tunneling, slay giant and evil, and resist fear, acid,  lightning, fire and cold 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
I stow Caspanion for possible future use and head to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to sell off loot. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, we've got, like, a million coin or something.  Do we <em>need</em> to keep selling stuff?" 
</p>
<p>
Rings of Extra Attacks and Scrolls of Artifact Creation can be even more expensive than that, especially from Black Markets.  We want to be able to buy stuff like that, right? 
</p>
<p>
<em>(shrug)</em> "&#8216;Kay." 
</p>
<p>
My Bree house, though, is absolutely jammed full, and I need to put these two artifact weapons somewhere.  Okay, looks like it's time to go to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Minas Anor</strong> 
</p>
<p>
and do the: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Haunted House quest</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"Excellent!  Haunted houses are cool.  And it's not even Halloween yet. What's the occasion?" 
</p>
<p>
Actually, this house really <em>is</em> haunted. 
</p>
<p>
"You mean with, like, real ghosts and stuff?  Whoa!  Why are we going in there, then?" 
</p>
<p>
Because if we can kill all the ghosts and undead in the house, we get to keep it. 
</p>
<p>
"Three houses?  Dude, we're gonna be on, like, Lifestyles of the Rich and Bear-shaped at this rate." 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  We just need the house for extra storage space; we won't be living here. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh.  &#8216;Kay.  Hey, if I'm gonna be fighting stuff, shouldn't I, like, be in bear form or something?" 
</p>
<p>
<em>[slaps forehead]</em> I keep forgetting about that. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/redface.png" alt=":o" height="15" width="15">  The quest goes quickly, netting my first Scroll of Mass Genocide and a Potion of Strength that takes me from 18/139 STR to 18/145. 
</p>
<p>
I make a few trips between houses rearranging stuff, ending up back in: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
where I net 3 Potions of Resist Heat from the Black Market, allowing me to ditch the Potion of Resistance. 
</p>
<p>
"Okay, so it's resist fire you're interested in.  So we're gonna be running into some really nasty, like, fire thing down at the bottom of Moria, then." 
</p>
<p>
Yes, good catch. 
</p>
<p>
"Hang on, I've got a fire extinguisher around here somewhere&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Um&#8230; yeah.  We'll be returning to MoM 48 next time out. 
</p>
<h4 id="head-32a7afd88348b06542a79f18c3377d41272a6ad5">Part 2 of 2</h4>
<p>
<strong>MoM 48</strong>, take 2 
</p>
<p>
"You have an excellent feeling&#8230;"  There are some Hezrou and Water hounds off to our north. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, that reminds me, what was supposed to be, like, so superb about that last level?" 
</p>
<p>
<em>(shrug)</em> Beats me.  After a bit of wandering, and dealing with those Water hounds, I finally get back around to those original Hezrou, who drop my first Potion of Augmentation. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15">  The rest of the level proceeds without incident, beyond collecting a few baubles: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Metal Brigandine Armour of the Rohirrim [+15] (+2), with +2 STR,  DEX and speed, and resist fear, acid, lightning, fire, cold, confusion and  sound 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Shrunken Head of Nightmares, which activates for experience loss 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
The junkart is obviously useless, but the armor looks useful, so I'll take it back with me.  Onward, then, to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>MoM 49</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You hear the sound of a market." 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa, big dragon!  Hey, back off, you!" 
</p>
<p>
Itangast is right next to me as I enter the level.  Fortunately, he falls in three turns; unfortunately, he drops nothing of interest.  The dungeon town turns out to be in the "scattered" form. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, no mall?  Major inconvenience." 
</p>
<p>
<em>(shrug)</em> Blame the city planners, I suppose.  The level is uneventful for a while, until I blunder across my first Hru. 
</p>
<p>
"Who?" 
</p>
<p>
Not 'who', Hru.  They do nasty melee damage, but they're only speed +10, so I can probably hack-n-back it.  I Phase-Door out into a nearby room to set it up&#8212;and find another Hru approaching.  Urk.  Okay, let's see how this works.  Hmm, the stunning effect of my bear-form attacks tends to screw up the rhythm.  I try hanging in the fight, hoping he stays stunned; he doesn't of course, and smacks me down to 256/596hp before I teleport out. Okay, then, this will take strategy&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
On the way back to the Hrus, a pack of Ghouls with an Ettin in the middle drop: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Tulwar of Tumelion (+1,+7) (+3), with +3 CHA, frost and poison  brand, chaotic effects, vampiric effects, and slay Xdragon and troll 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Sling of the Thain (x6) (+15,+15) (+4), with +4 DEX, CON, might and  shots and resist nether 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Man, my <a class="external" href="./www.killerbunnies.org/angband/ladder/bur/bur_5.html"><img src="./wiki/classic/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">Hobbit Summoner</a> could use that sling&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, that's alright, luv.  I've got the babies, they do most of the &#8216;eavy liftin', if you take my meaning." 
</p>
<p>
Sheesh, what is this, cameo night or something? 
</p>
<p>
"Oi! and what's wrong wit' a lady wantin' to see what she's got to look forward to?  I've only just got past Orc Town meself, y'know.  And yer bear friend looks to be havin' quite the time of it.  Could stand a bit of a trim, though, &#8216;e could&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
"Uh, dude, keep the spooky hobbit lady and her scissors away from me." 
</p>
<p>
Okay, break it up, you two.  Ah, here are the Hrus again.  This time I'm more careful:  I time my attack on a turn they miss, and then step back and wait for them to approach me before attacking again.  They do occasionally get two turns in a row at our current speed differential, so I have to be a little careful, but otherwise they go down fairly easily.  (Oh, I should probably mention another tactic I've adopted recently:  adjusting Tactic up to 'berzerker' for fights that I expect to be tough, like these.) 
</p>
<p>
After that showdown, the rest of the level seems rather boring.  The stores I found were an Axe Smith, a Polearm Smith, a Footwear Shop, a Rare Footwear Shop, a Scribe, and a Recaller; nothing of interest, really.  Now, though, it gets interesting: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>MoM 50</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  Not really, considering the room I enter into is full of Ogrillons and Water hounds.  I teleport out immediately, into a different room with assorted trolls and a 3-headed hydra.  Much better. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
"So, like, where's the big nasty fire thing?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, Sense Monsters doesn't detect him anywhere nearby; let's go looking for him&#8230;  Uh-oh, he just walked into the room we're in.  Okay, Bjorn, here goes&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"Right.  Halt, you very hot evildoer!" 
</p>
<p>
I toss back one of the !oRH's and dive into the fray&#8230; and it's over in three turns, and he only took me down to 542/596hp. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, that was, like, totally lame." 
</p>
<p>
I agree, Durin's Bane was way oversold; he didn't even have a demon escort, as my notes predicted.  He did have some interesting bits in his loot, though: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Bastard Sword 'Calris' (5d4) (-20,+20), with +5 CON, slay Xdragon,  troll, demon and evil, resist disenchantment, sense dragon and demon, drain  hp, aggravation, heavy curse and auto-curse 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Ring Mail of Telch [+1], with sustain DEX and CON, free action, and  resist confusion and chaos 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Well, mildly interesting, at least.  And as long as I'm *ID*ing, stuff, there's this junkart I picked up earlier: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Bigby's Big Book of Brutality, which activates for summon pet 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
"What a waste, dude." 
</p>
<p>
Well, there is a large and rather nasty-looking vault below us, near the southwest corner of the level; maybe it'll have something interesting in it.  Let's check the rest of the level first, though&#8230; okay, here's another vault, near the center of the level. 
</p>
<p>
A quick sweep of the rest of the level nets a randart Thunderlord Coat and pushes me to <em>clvl 41</em>, with skill points going 1 to Bearform-combat, 1 to Temporal, and 3 to Spell-power.  Essence of Speed is up to spell effect level 48, bringing my top speed back up to +25, and I now have 13 attacks in bear form. 
</p>
<p>
Okay, back to the second vault, which appears to be a lesser vault (temple of sety)&#8212;and already there's a Lesser Balrog tunneling its way out to me.  It falls without too much trouble, since I had a chance to prepare for it; there's another one in the vault, though, which I lure out and take down as it wakes up.  There's nothing else dangerous in the vault, and no interesting loot, beyond a Ring of Damage one point higher than the one I'm wearing. 
</p>
<p>
Back to the first vault, then, which, now that I look at it, doesn't actually appear to correspond to any of the vaults in lib/edit/v_info.txt. It's a large maze structure, lined heavily with traps.  Here's what it looked like after I cleaned it out:

</pre>Shadowfax is already emerging out of the entry at the north; I teleport him away.  Nasty monsters in the vault include a Lesser Balrog, two Master mystics, and a Nycadaemon, who summons another Master mystic.  Fortunately, since it's a maze, there's usually a corner I can lure them around to ambush them.  The Nycadaemon has me worried for a bit, though; it seems even tougher than the Lesser Balrog, and by the time I kill it, it appears to have done about 150hp of damage just from the fire-aura effect of me hitting it. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/alert.png" alt="/!\" height="15" width="15">

<p>
"Uh, I thought this was the bottom, dude.  How are we gonna go down from here?" 
</p>
<p>
Remember I said Moria had two exits?  Well, one of them is at the bottom.

"Oh&#8230; whuh?"

Here, let me show you:

"Whoa, dude, we're on top of the mountains!  Wait, how did we get way up here by going <em>down</em> in the dungeon?

Umm&#8230; let me get back to you on that.  We proceed south to:

<strong>Khazad-dum</strong>

Sorry, no snow bunnies; this is where the Dwarves that work in Moria live.

<p>
"Oh&#8230; were there dwarves working in Moria while we were in there?" 
</p>
<p>
We must have missed them.

<strong>MoM 50</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a good feeling&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
"Uh, dude, why are we back in the dungeon?" 
</p>
<p>
We have to recall from the dungeon to get back to Lothlorien.  If we'd recalled from Khazad-dum, we'd have lost the link to Lorien, and we would've had to climb all the way back out of Moria the hard way. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh&#8230; why?" 
</p>
<p>
Because Moria has two exits.  Remember the map bug coming out of Lothlorien after recalling from Moria?  It's related to that. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh.  &#8216;Kay.  That'll make it kinda hard to come back, though, won't it?" 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, but we probably won't be coming back very often.  Anyway, I kill off a few nearby monsters and ID a few items on the floor of the room where I enter&#8212;and one of them is The Demonhorn of Gothmog. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/alert.png" alt="/!\" height="15" width="15">  That's the very last scrap of space in my pack, though, so I recall back to:

Ack!  Maybe we <em>did</em> lose the link to Lorien.  Oh well, at least we came out at the top exit, near:

<p>
<strong>Bree</strong>

<p>
where we sell off loot and *ID*: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>

 The Demonhorn of Gothmog [+13] (-5), with radius-2 light, -5 CHA, see  invisible, sense demon, slow digestion, regeneration, and auto-curse

The randart Ring Mail is pretty much useless, so I sell it (and to confirm my judgment, it only goes for 7722gp); the potentially useful stuff I stow here, leaving Gothmog and Calris to stow in:

<p>
<strong>Minas Anor</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Back in: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
the Black Market has some Athelas, which I buy to augment my stockpile. 
</p>
<p>
"So now where to, dude?" 
</p>
<p>
Next we have some quests to pick off&#8230; 
</p>
<h3 id="head-da7b2d70bdb4d3f386edb83e7c3613def3aa8e14">INTERMISSION:  Indiana Bjorn and the Last Relic Quest</h3>
<p>
First off, we're going to do the fifth and final relic quest. 
</p>
<p>
"Uh, dude, I thought we weren't doing any of those Manwe god dude quest things anymore.  Remember, really fast See-through hounds?  Butt-kicking by mushrooms?" 
</p>
<p>
That wasn't you, that was the other Bjorn. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, right&#8230; whuh?" 
</p>
<p>
Besides, this time we've got an edge.  Our spell effect level for the Vision spell is high enough to map and light the entire level&#8212;which also reveals everything on the floor of the level. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, I get it.  So if the relic thing is there, we know right where to go to get it.  And if it's not there, we don't have to search the whole level to find out, we can just, like, go right to the stairs to the next level." 
</p>
<p>
Even better:  remember, the quest code attempts to place the relic every time the level is generated.  So if the relic isn't on the first level of the temple, we just climb back out to the surface and go back in again to regenerate the level and try for the relic again. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa, totally devious!  Dude, is that legal?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, no doubt there are some who would consider it cheesy; under the circumstances, though, I'm prepared to live with it. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  <em>[Editor's note:  I'm actually taking some literary license here; in fact, I already used this trick for the third and fourth relic quests, following the suggestion from <a class="external" href=".www.t-o-m-e.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=33902#33902"><img src="./wiki/classic/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">Atarlost and Quixote</a>.]</em> 
</p>
<p>
Now we've just got to find it.  Let's see&#8230; <em>[consults map]</em> "quite some way to the south-west of Bree and a long way to the north-west of Minas Anor" looks like it works out to somewhere south of the Old Forest, near where the Greyflood hits the sea. 
</p>
<p>
"So, Manwe god dude still isn't one for road maps, eh?" 
</p>
<p>
As you say.  Since we're going to be wandering around near deep water, I'm gonna turn off the shimmering effects for a while.  We acquire a fate while we're looking; remind me to check that when we get back home, Bjorn. 
</p>
<p>
"&#8216;Kay." 
</p>
<p>
And it looks like my map-reading skills need some work; I eventually find the temple in the mountains southwest of the Old Forest, about halfway to the Sandworm Lair. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/redface.png" alt=":o" height="15" width="15">  Okay, here we go: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LTm -25</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"This level can't be all bad&#8230;"  Nope, no relic here; let's try again: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LTm -25</strong>, take 2 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like any other level."  Oops, Clear hounds next to me, and I'm not ready.  They get in a couple hits on me as I power up and cast Vision; luckily the relic isn't on this level, so I can just bolt and try again: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LTm -25</strong>, take 3 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like any other level."  The level is a 3x5 small level; I enter into an unconnected tiny room, and the relic is in another room nearby:

</pre>(I've taken the liberty of replacing the relic on the map with my preferred circle-R symbol so that it can be distinguished from all the pools of water.)  Hmm, I could just Phase Door out of here, but that might land me in line of sight of that Quasit with his teleport-level spell.  I wonder if the relic is in range of my Recall spell&#8230; nope.  Okay, let's try using it to swap positions with that Young spirit off to our southwest&#8230; ah, much better.  A short hop later and the relic is in our&#8230; um, Manwe's grasp. 
</p>
<p>
"So that's it, huh?  That's all the pieces of this relic thing?" 
</p>
<p>
Yep.  I think this is the first time I've completed all five relic quests with a character. 
</p>
<p>
"Man, that was downright anti-climatical after that mushroom butt-kicking incident." 
</p>
<p>
Um&#8230; yeah.  Now let's go back home and see what I can do with all this Prayer skill&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, don't forget to wind your watch&#8230; uh, I mean, check your fate. ('Wind your watch'?  Man, where'd <em>that</em> come from?)"

</p>
<p>
"Dude, would it be wrong of me to say that the nice Elf lady is hot?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, I wouldn't say it to her face.  Or to her husband's. 
</p>
<p>
"Aw, man, the hot ones are always taken." 
</p>
<p>
Ah, to be young and hormonal again&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  The Black Market has a Potion of Strength that takes me from 18/130 STR to 18/136.  Hmm, must be getting close to max on that one. 
</p>
<p>
Okay, now it's time for some spell review.  My Prayer skill level is now 15.000; I've got 28 spare skill points in my skill plan aimed for Prayer (it was previously 25, but I got a Fumblefingers boost to Conveyance), which at a multiplier of 0.500 would increase it to 29.000.  I'm currently getting a +17 boost to spell effect level from Spell-power, which will increase to +20 once I've maxed that skill. 
</p>
<p>
Now, let's check our Holy Tome of Manwe Sulimo.  Manwe's Blessing is currently at spell effect level 32, so it now has all the effects, including the temporary luck boost and hold life; an increase in spell effect level would only buy me increased duration.  Wind Shield is currently at spell effect level 23, so it too now has the full shield effect, including retaliatory damage; an increase in spell effect level would buy me increased duration and a slight increase in AC bonus and retaliatory damage amount.  I'm close to being able to cast Manwe's Call, and with this allocation, it will max out at spell effect level 30, summoning level-62 Great eagles&#8212;which, by my calculations, should average +35 speed, 468hp, 185AC, and nearly doubled attack damage.  Not bad, but I'd have to adjust my "friendlies" strategy.  Avatar, alas, is out of reach. 
</p>
<p>
Then there's the side schools for Manwe.  29 in Prayer is equivalent to 19 in Air, which would net me the Poison Blood and Invisibility spells. Invisibility is probably useless; the temporary resist poison from Poison Blood would be useful at times, but its poison brand effect only works with weapons.  Actually, I'd get Wings of Winds too, with my high Conveyance skill, but I'm already getting levitation and flight from Manwe prayer. Oh, and we can't forget Noxious Cloud, currently at spell effect level 25&#8212;only five levels away from doing 'unbreath' damage. 
</p>
<p>
Let's see, we also get Meta and Conveyance from Prayer with Manwe. Conveyance I've already got more than adequately covered; for Meta, I get an effective skill level of 9 from 29 Prayer, which would only me the Recharge spell.  Actually, I can already cast that at my current skill level; I should try to pick up a spellbook for that. 
</p>
<p>
As for my "normal" schools, I've already got all the spells in Divination and Temporal, though I'm currently only using Essence of Speed from the Temporal school.  Wonder if there's anything else useful there&#8230; hmm, Banishment doesn't really buy me anything that I'm not already getting from Teleport Away, Slow Monsters is probably redundant since I'm already faster than most monsters (and the ones I'm not faster than are probably the very ones that would resist the spell anyway), and the glyphs of warding from Magelock don't really fit into my playing strategy.  In Conveyance, I've got every spell but Probability Travel, and I'd only need five more skill points to pick that up.  Hmm, I hadn't originally planned on picking that one up, but I do have the skill points to spare; I wonder how useful it would be.  Opinions from the audience?

<p>
Next we're going to do the Library quest in Minas Anor. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, I know all about that, dude.  Every time I go to the library, it's like some major quest just to find the book I want." 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15"> Not that kind of quest.  There's an Old Mage in Minas Anor whose library has been invaded by monsters; we're going to go clear them out. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh.  We aren't gonna get to, like, keep the library afterward, are we?" 
</p>
<p>
No, it's not a house quest.  Instead he'll make a custom spellbook for us. 
</p>
<p>
"Aw, bogus, man, not <em>another</em> spellbook to carry around&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Don't worry, it'll replace one of the books you're carrying.  Besides, you've got it better than the other Bjorn; he didn't have nearly the luck with Tomes that you've had.  He was carrying seven books when he died, and didn't have nearly as many spells as you did. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, yeah, and he had to hike five miles to the dungeon through waist-deep snow, uphill both ways.  Seen it, taped it, taped over it, dude." 
</p>
<p>
Sheesh, young'uns these days&#8230;  One last thing to do before I head out:  I use my last bit of fireproofing from the Old Mage quest to fireproof the Holy Tome of Manwe Sulimo I've been saving up. 
</p>
<p>
"What about that Time Tome you were saving?" 
</p>
<p>
I won't need it after the quest.  That done, we proceed to:

<strong>Minas Anor</strong>

Just for the variety, I made a <a class="external" href="./www.killerbunnies.org/angband/ladder/cmov/cmov3.html"><img src="./wiki/classic/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">cmovie</a> of the quest, which turned out to be rather pedestrian.  I picked up one junkart in the quest:

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Gem of Knowledge, activates for teleport 100 every 45 turns 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
For the custom book, I went with Manathrust, Globe of Light, and Essence of Speed. 
</p>
<p>
"But dude, you've already got the speed spell on that necklace thing." 
</p>
<p>
Yes, but I'll almost certainly want to swap in another amulet eventually; the Amulet of the Magi's bonuses are nice, but the to-hit and to-dam penalties are annoying.  With that taken care of, we return to:

<em>(shrug)</em> "Dunno.  That's just what they're called.

"So why are we going there first?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, Mordor's got a lot of lava streamers in it, and there's a guaranteed source of fire immunity at the bottom of the Land of Mountains. 
</p>
<p>
"But all our spellbooks are fireproof now, right?  Well, except the one with the be-nice spell in it, but we don't use that one much anymore." 
</p>
<p>
True, but the lava will still do damage to <em>us</em>. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, okay.  So what's this Land of Mountains like?" 
</p>
<p>
Like Moria, but tougher.  Mostly flying monsters&#8212;dragons, demons, stuff like that. 
</p>
<p>
"Cool.  Let's do it." 
</p>
<p>
That's the spirit.  On the way overland to LoM, though, I get a fate.  Mm, should I go back?  If I don't, Murphy's Law says it'll be a death fate on the level I'm about to enter.  Oh well, back to:

where I learn that I'm fated to find a Scroll of Door/Stair Location on dlvl 27. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  Let's try this again, shall we?  This time I actually make it all the way to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 45</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  What, just for a change? <img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  The level is boring for a bit, until I run into Quaker.  Hmm, he's tough, but he's only normal speed.  I back up and fire up Manwe's Blessing and Wind Shield (I think I'm gonna like this new addition to my arsenal&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> ) and pummel him down in four turns.  Hmph, he seemed pretty stunned for a monster that's supposed to be resistant to stunning. 
</p>
<p>
"Well, hey, we are the power team, right, dude?" 
</p>
<p>
Indeed.  I get an opportunity to try one of my other new spells when a Drolem shows up&#8230; oh, that's right, I can't cast Poison Blood yet. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/redface.png" alt=":o" height="15" width="15"> Remind me to push Prayer my next few clvls, Bjorn. 
</p>
<p>
"&#8216;Kay." 
</p>
<p>
Doesn't matter, though, the Drolem dies quickly enough.  A bit further in, I get a reminder of why one doesn't approach an AMHD head-on down a straight corridor; one lightning breath drops me to 395/625hp.  Not to worry, though; I just Phase Door out and lure him into an ambush. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, my hair's gonna be standing on end for a week.  Bummer." 
</p>
<p>
You think that's bad?  Take a look at these two rings dropped by an Ancient black dragon further in: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Ring of Gilir (-4%), with -4 STR, DEX and critical hits, sustain  WIS, see invisible, drain exp, random teleportation, Black Breath and heavy  curse 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Ring of Lohtar (-3), with -3 searching, invisibility, sustain CON,  see invisible, random teleportation, Black Breath, heavy curse and TY curse 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
"Whoa, totally heinous.  You win, dude." 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  Maybe we'll have better luck on: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 46</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have an excellent feeling&#8230;"  Not with that AMHD right down the corridor, I don't.  Hmm, it seems to be asleep, let's see if I can sneak up on it&#8230; slam dunk!  And it takes me over the top to <em>clvl 42</em>. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, you wanna push&#8211;" 
</p>
<p>
Prayer, right; specifically, 3 to Prayer, 1 to Bearform-combat and 1 to Temporal.  One more of those and I should be able to cast Poison Blood.  To continue the positive swing, I find a Potion of Dexterity in a nearby room, taking me from 18/100 DEX to 18/103.  Hmm, I'm getting quite a few stats close to max. 
</p>
<p>
The level turns out to be a 1x3 small level, and thus goes swiftly, netting another Potion of Dexterity (and 18/106 DEX thereby) and: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Heavy Crossbow of Elron (x5) (+4,+7) (+1), with radius-1 light and  +1 STR, INT, WIS, DEX, CON, speed, might and shots 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Hmm, tough call between this and The Long Bow of Gured that I'm currently wielding; I'd lose a point of STR, DEX and CON and gain a point of INT, WIS and speed.  I'll take it with me for later consideration.  In the meantime, the level is done, and we proceed to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 47</strong> 
</p>
<p>
All together now:  "You have a superb feeling about this level." 
</p>
<p>
"You know, it kinda loses its impact after a while." 
</p>
<p>
It does indeed&#8212;especially when there's nothing noticeably superb about the level.  Well, I did get this from a pack of Cave trolls: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Iron Helm of Gorlim (+25,+25) [+10] (-5), which activates for rays  of fear and has -5 INT, WIS and searching, immunity to cold, free action,  resist fear, acid, fire, poison and disenchantment, see invisible,  anti-magic shell, drain hp, random teleportation, heavy curse and TY curse 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
but I wouldn't call that superb. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, I'd call that heinous." 
</p>
<p>
I agree wholeheartedly.  We'll try again on: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 48</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a good feeling&#8230;"  Kinda slow for a while, until I run into Kavlax.  He wakes up and gets in a lightning breath as I'm bringing up Manwe's Blessing and Wind Shield, taking me to 453/635hp.  Hmm, he's got some nasty breaths, including sound, which I don't currently resist, and gravity, which AFAIK I <em>can't</em>; should I bolt? 
</p>
<p>
"No way, dude, this guy's messed up my hair again.  Kick his butt!" 
</p>
<p>
Your command is my wish, Bjorn.  Kavlax falls in two turns and drops nothing of interest.  Further exploration reveals that the level is a 1x5 small level, so it passes quickly, netting a Potion of Wisdom from a Shade. Onward, then, to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 49</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You hear the sound of a market." 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa, there's a mall way up here in the mountains?  Looks like a dump, though." 
</p>
<p>
Well, supposedly there used to be lots of towns up here; this looks like the ruins of one of them. 
</p>
<p>
"Ruins, huh?  Has anyone told the shopkeepers?" 
</p>
<p>
Speaking of which, the shops in town include an Expensive Black Market, a Soothsayer, a Hafted Smith, a Polearm Smith, a Footwear Shop, a Common Shop, an Axe Smith and a Recaller. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, don't trust those mall fortune tellers.  They're all fakes." 
</p>
<p>
Heh.  Nothing of interest in the stores, besides a Potion of *Healing* from the Expensive Black Market for my stockpile.  The rest of the level is fairly straightforward, beyond a Draconic Q that summons a Death drake. First Death drake since&#8230; <em>*shudder*</em>  This time, though, I have resist nether&#8212;and more important, I'm mobile. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, that's what you get for killing me&#8230; I mean, killing my&#8230; uh&#8230; dude, can you explain it to me again?" 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> One more point of interest:  a Potion of Strength dropped by a pack of Vrocks.  I think one more of those will max my STR.  Oh, and on the way to the stairs, an AMHD drops: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Steel Helm 'Lebohaum' [20,+80], which activates for sing a cheerful  song every 3 turns 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
"Uh&#8230; it's a hat that sings?" 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, but it's got great armor class.  If our equipment slots weren't so restricted, it might be worth it. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, but dude, it <em>sings</em>.  That's as bad as those bogus animatronical talking fish things." 
</p>
<p>
Mm, I hadn't thought of it that way.  Anyway, let's move on to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 49</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  Yeah, I've heard that before.  Although this toy dropped by another Death drake isn't bad: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Ring 'Landel' (+4), with +4 INT and DEX, resist fear, cold and  poison, and slow digestion 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Good potential as a future swap-in.  Ah, this must be the source of the superb felling:  a vault.  Looks like a small one, though.  We'll come back for this. 
</p>
<p>
Hmm, or maybe this is the superb bit:  Smaug's sitting in the middle of a room not far from the vault.  All right, Bjorn, power up and let's head in. 
</p>
<p>
"Right.  <em>Oh, mighty god dude Manwe, grant me your protection&#8230;</em>" 
</p>
<p>
Well, our stealth must be improving, because we sneak right up on him.  He gets in a couple good hits, including a cause-wounds spell, but he falls in three turns and drops, among other junk: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Iron Helm 'Holhenneth' [+10] (+2), which activates for detection  every 55+d55 turns and has +2 INT, WIS and searching, resist blindness and  see invisible 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Lucerne Hammer 'Turmil' (+10,+6) [+8] (+4), which activates for  drain life (90) every 70 turns and has +4 WIS and infravision, frost brand,  slay orc, resist cold, poison and light, sense orc, troll and giant, and  regeneration 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Seeker Arrow 'Bullseye' (7d4) (+20,+15), with acid, lightning,  fire, frost and poison brands and slay dragon, orc, troll, giant, Xdemon,  undead, evil and animal 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Not bad, but now my pack is full.  Well, let's see how much more of the level I can do. 
</p>
<p>
Not much further without making some decisions, it seems; a troll pit nets: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Cutlass 'Gondricam' (+10,+11) (+3), with +3 DEX and stealth, resist  acid, lightning, fire and cold, levitation, see invisible and regeneration 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Whip of Gothmog (3d6) (+15,+16) (-2), with -2 INT, DEX and  infravision, fire brand, vorpal effects, wounding, slay demon and animal,  resist fire and light, sense spiders and demons, regeneration, drain hp,  aggravation and heavy curse 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Urk.  Okay, I can put Bullseye in the quiver, and ditch this Sprig of Athelas&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
The rest of the level finishes without incident, so I return to the vault, which appears to be a lesser vault (Minor Boss Vault) with nothing but a Silver mouse and a Quarterstaff of Slay Evil in it.  Talk about anticlimactic.  And I <em>really</em> need to get out of here: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Loth</strong><tt>^H^H^H^H</tt><strong>Wilderness</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Oh yeah, I keep forgetting about that.  Let's see, first let's go to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to stow some stuff.  Hmm, I can sell off this Ring of Poison Resistance now, since it's a strict subset of what Landel's got.  And speaking of selling stuff, next stop is: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to sell off the one bit of saleable kit I managed to get out of the dungeon with (a Frozen Broad Sword of *Slay Demon*) and offload some of these artifacts&#8212;at least the ones that'll fit; the rest have to go to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Minas Anor</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Man, I miss the large Mathom-house&#8230;  Back in: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
I restock and prepare to return to LoM 49 next time out. 
</p>
<h4 id="head-ac39c860a9df705e74b78f8c602a7a5a813685c7">Part 2 of 9</h4>
<p>
<strong>LoM 49</strong>, take 2 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like any other level."  Man, my stealth must <em>really</em> be improving; I just waded through an entire pack of Vrocks, and not one of themem woke up.  A few rooms further in, I find lying on the floor a Mongbat raw meat.  Presumably dropped there just to squick me. <em>*shudder*</em> 
</p>
<p>
"Eww, that is totally&#8230;" <em>*sniff sniff*</em>  "Saaaaay&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
No.  I've heard enough horror stories about eating pieces of the wrong monsters and getting blown up or something. 
</p>
<p>
"Aw, man&#8230;" <em>*sniff*</em>  "Ugh, on second, thought, maybe you're right. Being in bear form does weird things to my appetite." 
</p>
<p>
Nothing much to report for a while, until I find myself entering a rather large dark room, with a Time vortex nearby and a white '<tt>p</tt>' off on the far side.  Okay, the human I can probably ignore for now; the Time vortex definitely has higher priority&#8211; 
</p>
<p>
<em>The Ranger chieftain magically summons monsters!</em> 
</p>
<p>
And I'm surrounded by Hill trolls.  Oh.  Okay, that's mildly annoying; now I have to fight through the trolls to get to the Time vort&#8211; 
</p>
<p>
<em>The Time vortex breathes time.  You feel life has clocked back.  The Ranger chieftain magically summons monsters!</em> 
</p>
<p>
And now, along with the trolls, the vortex and the increasingly annoying Ranger chieftain, I'm looking at two Qs, a Vampire bat, and a Dreadmaster. 
</p>
<p>
"Uh, dude, maybe we should get out of here." 
</p>
<p>
No, not us; I think everyone <em>else</em> should go.  One Teleport Away spell later, all that's left (briefly) is a single Hill troll that got stuck in one of the corridors entering the room, just out of my line of sight.  Kinda feels good teleporting a Nexus Q away for a change&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
Well, I guess I should go hunt these twerps down.  The Nexus Q, speak of the devil, didn't go far; he's in a corridor not far from the room I'm in, perfectly positioned at a corner for me to sneak up on him and <em>SMACK</em> him very hard&#8230;  <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15">  The rest seem to have been scattered to the winds.  The one guy I <em>didn't</em> want to run into, of course, was the Knight Templar I teleported away earlier to avoid taking the piety hit for killing him; naturally, that's exactly who I blunder into and smack around while not paying attention across a screen change.  I teleport him away again, but alas, the damage is done, and he bleeds to death somewhere offscreen. 
</p>
<p>
"Aw man, too bad.  Guess we need to go kill something really nasty to make up for it, huh?" 
</p>
<p>
Ah, the inveterate optimism of youth&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  The trolls and the Vampire bat apparently ended up loosely bunched in the area of a few adjacent rooms; individually, they fall quickly.  And apparently the Time vortex was right offscreen from them, as it has just wandered in to play.  I warn you, though, we play rough&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
More searching&#8230; and look, here comes Scatha to play with us.  <em>[checks notes]</em> Hmm, he's almost as tough as Smaug, but not quite. 
</p>
<p>
"<em>*snort*</em> Smog wasn't so tough.  Let's do it.  Halt, you very cold evildoer!" 
</p>
<p>
Heh.  Scatha, like Smaug, turned out to be a three-turn wonder (once I remembered to crank up Tactic, that is); he drops: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Mithril Chain Mail 'Elkaist' (-9,-56) [28,+13](40%), with +40% hp,  sustain WIS and CON, and resist fire and resist fire and dark 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Ouch, not with that huge damage penalty; let it lie.  Hmm, just north of here, near the northwest corner, there appears to be a vault of some sort. We'll come back for that&#8230; hmm, no, actually, it looks like I <em>have</em> to go through the vault to get to the rest of the level.  It turns out to be a lesser vault (Little League Treasure Hoard)&#8212;and "little league" turns out to be an apt description of the "hoard" therein, too. 
</p>
<p>
In a large room/cavern a short hop to the west of the vault, I <em>finally</em> find that annoying Ranger chieftain&#8212;and he's bought a friend this time.  But this time, I've got a corridor corner to lure him around. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15">  Hmm, looks like he also brought some of the trolls and the Dreadmaster from the original gaggle, not to mention a Vampire lord, who had the courtesy to drop not one but <em>two</em> Potions of Dexterity. And my DEX is now maxed at 18/110. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> <img src="./wiki/classic/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
And that finishes the level.  Onward, then, to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 51</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  Mm, nearby monsters are interesting, but not superb.  Let's see what we've got here&#8230;  well, here's something kinda superb from that Ancient black dragon I saw coming in: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
  The Ring of Belduin (+1), with +1 DEX and stealth, sustain STR and  INT, resist acid, shards and nether, and slow digestion 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Well, maybe not superb <em>per se</em>, but not bad. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, dude, do you hear fighting nearby?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, let's go check.  And look who's here again:  Beorn, fighting a Vampire lord&#8212;and not doing well, considering that the Vampire lord is as yet unharmed.  A Cloud giant is sleeping nearby; must be a heavy sleeper. 
</p>
<p>
"Aw man, is he crazy or something?  Get us in there, dude, we gotta bail him out." 
</p>
<p>
As you say.  We cast Recall to swap places with Beorn and take down the Vampire lord. 
</p>
<p>
"Wh&#8211; hey!  I had him, ya crazy cub!" 
</p>
<p>
"Gramps, you weren't even hitting him.  Now I better take out this Very large electric guy, just in case." 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, no ya don't, ya whelp!  <em>I'll</em> handle that. <em>Mizzleflam!</em>" A Killer brown beetle appears next to the Cloud giant&#8212;and misses him. 
</p>
<p>
"Ooh, yeah, good shot.  Here, I'll&#8211;" 
</p>
<p>
Let him take this one, Bjorn. 
</p>
<p>
"Why?" 
</p>
<p>
It might help get you back on his good side. 
</p>
<p>
"Rgh&#8230; oh, okay.  But that giant bug's not gonna cut it."  We cast Recall to swap Beorn back into place.  "There, Gramps, you want him, you got him." Two turns later, Beorn takes down the Cloud giant&#8212;after summoning another pack of Giant army ants to help and losing half his hit points in the process, but we'll overlook that. 
</p>
<p>
"And <em>that's</em> how you kill a giant.  Run along now, friends."  The insects scatter off into the dungeon. <em>[Actually, I dismiss them. -ed]</em>  "Hmph&#8230; well&#8230; you're looking fit, lad.  That bulky chain mail doesn't suit ya, though." 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, I keep telling dude that, but he says I gotta wear it." 
</p>
<p>
It's our best source of resist poison for now. 
</p>
<p>
"Ah&#8230; yes, well, poison resistance is important down at these depths." 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah&#8230; so&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
"Yes, well&#8230; you, you watch yourself down here, lad.  It's dangerous at these depths.  Believe me, I know."  And Beorn wanders off. <em>[Yes, I dismissed him again, but that doesn't write up as well. -ed]</em> 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, did that just happen?" 
</p>
<p>
It did. 
</p>
<p>
"He didn't insult me, or call me an inexperienced kid or nothing.  Wait, this whole parallel business couldn't have accidentally swapped him with a cool Grampa Beorn from some alternate dimension, could it?" 
</p>
<p>
Not to my knowledge.  He may actually be developing some respect for you. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Awww&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  The level proceeds with incident for a while, until I run into the Queen Ant a few rooms further in. 
</p>
<p>
"Wait, haven't I already killed her?  No, wait&#8230; was that, like, the other me?" 
</p>
<p>
Very good, you're getting the hang of this. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, I have <em>gotta</em> lay off those mushrooms&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Or not. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  Her Antness is, alas, awake as I enter the room, and summons Giant fire ants around me.  I drop some Noxious Clouds in the area to clear a path, and the Queen Ant makes the mistake of charging me instead of summoning more ants.  She falls in two turns, and what's left of her entourage doesn't last much longer.  She drops nothing of interest. 
</p>
<p>
The level is rather boring for a while, until I find an innocent looking pit-style room, the kind with the tiny "pillar" room in the middle.  Well whatever is in that pillar-room has a summon-monster spell, as it demonstrates by summoning Crebains and Half-trolls at me from around the corner&#8212;at least, I <em>think</em> it's in there, but it's not showing up on Sense Monsters.  After clearing out the rabble, I finally make it into the room to find that the cause of my troubles was a Greater mimic.  At least it has the decency to leave me a Potion of Strength in recompence. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  And that maxes my STR at 18/160. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> <img src="./wiki/classic/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
And just as I think I've finished the level, Thranduil's sense evil picks up a pack of ancient dragons, including two AMHDs (one a Zombie), two Ethereal dragons, a Dracolisk and a Dracolich. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/alert.png" alt="/!\" height="15" width="15">  Okay, first I need to find a corner to set up the ambush&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
Well, that wasn't too bad.  The toughest, of course, were the Dracolisk and the Dracolich, taking four turns each.  In most cases I could finish a dragon before the next one came around the corner, but even when I didn't, the extra dragons made the mistake of not breathing on me.  Between them, they dropped: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Jewel 'Evenstar' (+3), which activates for restore stats and life  levels every 750 turns and has +3 CON, sustain INT, WIS and CON, hold life,  resist cold, dark and nether, and regeneration 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Bolt 'Aindin' (+12,-1) (+3), with +3 CON and attacks, chaotic  effects, slay orc, troll and undead, and blessed 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/alert.png" alt="/!\" height="15" width="15"> Oh, man, are the +3 attacks worth the chaotic effects?  We'll try it for a while and see what happens. 
</p>
<p>
"Right.  <em>*rrg rmph*</em> Uh, dude, it won't go in the quiver." 
</p>
<p>
That's because we're currently wielding a Long Bow.  Let's see, there's <em>gotta</em> be a crossbow somewhere in this pile of dragon loot&#8230; @#$%. We'll have to go find one.  <em>[scans map]</em>  Oh yeah, there's one in that long corridor along the south edge of the level, back where we took out a pack of Water trolls.  Some Light hounds seem to have taken up residence in the corridor now, but they're quickly evicted, and with a bit of equipment juggling, I'm now the proud owner of 16 attacks per round and 700 hit points, <em>without</em> Manwe's Blessing active. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> <img src="./wiki/classic/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
And after that, the last few bits of the level are downright anti-climactic.  We continue to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 52</strong>

<p>
"You have a good feeling&#8230;"  I'm only 5000 or so exp away from the next level, and sure enough, a pack of Multi-hued hounds pushes me over the top to <em>clvl 43</em>, with skill points going 1 to Bearform-combat and 4 to Prayer.  I can now cast Poison Blood&#8212;and I do, in case any of these hounds gets a breath in on me. 
</p>
<p>
The level turns out to be a 1x3 small level, and interestingly, there's a room on the north end that appears entirely inaccessible&#8212;and according to Sense Monsters, it's swarming with Greater wall monsters: 
<pre>                                   ###

</pre>Hmm, normally I'd leave vaults for last, but I guess I'd better get in there before they take over the entire room.  I use Recall to swap myself with the Spirit troll on the west side of the room and set to work. 
</p>
<p>
The room turns out to be just another pillar-room-style pit room.  And I don't think I can keep ahead of these crazy breeding monsters, either. After a valiant effort, and down to 490/715hp, I Recall-swap the Spirit troll back in and write the room off as a loss. 
</p>
<p>
The rest of the level proceeds swiftly and without incident.  We'll proceed to LoM 53 next time.  Oh, might as well <a class="external" href="./www.killerbunnies.org/angband/bear/bear_3.html"><img src="./wiki/classic/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">update the dump</a> while I'm at it. 
</p>
<h4 id="head-d129ac4fafc7977a974e2e29d4ce2b3b7290e880">Part 3 of 9</h4>
<p>
<strong>LoM 53</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  Whatever.  The level starts boring and doesn't improve much.  One of the few highlights is another disconnected pit-style room, this time the four-subroom version.  I Recall-swap in with a Mind flayer, since it looked isolated&#8212;and discover that it wasn't, as I find myself in a subroom with six Water hounds, a Water spirit and a Demonic Q.  <img src="./wiki/classic/img/alert.png" alt="/!\" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
"Uh-oh, we better get out of here." 
</p>
<p>
No, I think we're okay; another tactical swap with that Cave ogre in the outer ring just outside this subroom should take care of us for now.  I clear out the other three subrooms fairly easily, and them come back for the Water hounds.  Unfortunately, they're pinned in their subroom behind the Demonic Q and a Yellow mushroom patch.  A carefully aimed Noxious Cloud takes care of the Mushroom patch&#8212;and the hounds, which I wasn't expecting.  Last to fall are the Demonic Q and the Vrocks it summoned before I could get to it. 
</p>
<p>
The rest of the level is as uneventful as the first part, netting two Potions of Intelligence from some Dreads and a Potion of Wisdom from some Gnouls.  I'm getting close to max on both of those, I think.  Pushing on, we proceed to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 54</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  I'm guessing another uninteresting level, and nothing within Sense Monster range is disabusing me of that notion. 
</p>
<p>
Hmm, there are some High elven ranger in a room north of me fighting off monsters.  I dismiss them; I want those exp for myself, after all&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15">  The room turns out to be a checkerboard-style pit room with some ghosts and dragons, who drop a Potion of Intelligence and: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Gruumsh's Bottle of Death, activates for teleport level 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Enh.  And the rest of the level is as "superb" as the first.  I'm about ready to give up on the level when a Blue Thunderlord gets the drop on me down a corridor and drops me to 496/715hp with a fire breath.  This, of course, cannot go unanswered&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15">  I duck back into the room I'd just left, toss back one of the Potions of Healing I've been collecting, and wait for him to come around the corner and get smacked down. 
</p>
<p>
One last sweep through the rest of the level reveals another disconnected four-subroom pit in the northwest corner, this time with The Phoenix as its star occupant.  I'll Recall-swap him out to deal with later, and take on the rest of the room first.  The room is fairly easy, and nets: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Amulet of Nahtalach (+3), with +3 infravision, sustain INT, DEX and  CHA, resist acid and slow digestion 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
That's not even slightly tempting; leave it.  Now, I need to get back out of here.  I could use Phase Door, but I might land in the room with The Phoenix and have it breathe on me.  Ah, there's an Angel in another nearby room that I can Recall-swap with.  Now to find a corner to ambush this bird around&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
Hmm, that fight wasn't as tough as I'd feared.  The Phoenix goes down in three turns and never hits me, though it does take me to 672/755hp from just the fire-aura backlash.  It drops nothing of interest. 
</p>
<p>
Hmm, before I leave the level, I notice that a Ghast back in the disconnected room did a hit on my CHA.  I wonder if I left any Potions of Restore Charisma lying around&#8230; <em>[scans map]</em> ah, yes, there's one nearby.  I go pick that up and then proceed to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 55</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"Wait, lemme do it, dude:  <em>*ahem*</em> 'You have, like, a superb feeling about this level.'" 
</p>
<p>
It'd probably work better with the 'like', actually. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  Some interesting monsters in Sense Monster range, but none I'd call superb. 
</p>
<p>
Explore, explore, doot de doot&#8230; hmm, there are some Ethereal hounds to our north; looks like they're lined up in a corridor.  That's reasonably superb, in the "nasty monsters" way.  They come out behind the Vampire lord and the Undead beholder ahead of them&#8212;the latter of which summons a Demilich behind me who knocks my DEX down to 18/90.  And by the time I've punched through the Undead beholder, the Ethereal hounds are coming around the corner and are about to start piling up on me. 
</p>
<p>
The Demilich, fortunately, blinks away into the corridor by which the hounds are approaching, and with a bit of maneuvering I get a proper corner-ambush position.  Most of the hounds fall before the Demilich comes back around the corner.  I pummel it down to one star before it blinks away again, this time into the corridor behind me.  Urk, and there's a Barbazu approaching from the front, too.  I take a small tactical risk and spend a couple turns Manathrusting the Demilich down as the Barbazu gets next to me.  The Barbazu, fortunately, only takes a couple turns to take down. 
</p>
<p>
"Man, this level ls less 'superb' than we thought&#8230; I mean more <em>superb</em> superb, less 'superb' superb&#8230; I mean&#8211;" 
</p>
<p>
I know what you mean, Bjorn, and yes, the level <em>is</em> turning out to be more harrowing than I'd expected.  That Demilich dropped quite a lot of high-level Tomes; if we weren't already well-stocked on that front, this would've been a jackpot. 
</p>
<p>
The level calms down for a bit after that, netting: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Beaked Axe of Erevor (2d6) (+13,+11) (+2), with radius-1 light, +2  DEX and attacks, acid brand, and slay dragon and troll 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
There also appears to be a vault in the middle of the level.  There also also appear to be a swarm of Greater wall monsters off to my west. Fortunately, they're contained in a single corridor opening into a smallish room with no other exits, so I manage to contain and eradicate them. 
</p>
<p>
"<em>*huff*</em> Dude, you never mentioned we'd be fighting the <em>walls</em> in this place&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
And they're easier to deal with here, since the main wall type in this dungeon is mountains, which even Greater wall monsters can't pass.  I don't even want to <em>think</em> about leveled GWMs in Angband&#8230; <em>*shudder*</em> 
</p>
<p>
The rest of the level proceeds mercifully without incident, and we return to the vault, which appears to be another non-match with v_info.txt: 
<pre>............'..###############.....^^^^^^^^^^

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.....^^^^^^^^^^^
</pre>The '<tt>Z</tt>'s here are Plasma hounds, and the '<tt>v</tt>' is a Plasma vortex, probably the toughest monsters in the room.  And after that swarm of Greater wall monsters, they're enough to push me over the top to <em>clvl 44</em>, with skill points going 1 to Bearform-combat, 1 to Temporal and 3 to Spell-power.  Essence of Speed is up to spell effect level 52, increasing my top speed to +26.  The vault nets a suit of Black Dragon Scail Mail and: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Full Plate Armour of Isildur [+25] (+1), with +1 CON and resist  acid, lightning, fire, cold, confusion, sound and nexus 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
That has potential; I'll take it back as a potential swap-in.  My pack is getting kinda full, though; I'll probably want to recall after the next level: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 56</strong> 
</p>
<p>
You know what I'm about to say about the level feeling, don't you? <img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15"> I enter at the southwest corner; off north, Sense Monsters is detecting, among other things, some Livingstones (which spooked me at first; I thought we already had a GWM infestation to deal with). 
</p>
<p>
And if I were a Mage, I would have just hit another jackpot, as a Demilich in a four-subroom pit drops three Mage Staffs (staves?), including a Mage Staff of Mana (+8,-5)(40%) and a Mage Staff of Power (+0,-6) (+8.).  Man, I've <em>got</em> to get a Sorceror this far&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"I'm here any time you want to try, lad. <em>(zizz)</em>" 
</p>
<p>
Um, yeah, that's okay, <a class="external" href="./www.killerbunnies.org/angband/ladder/zizzo/zizzo_15.html"><img src="./wiki/classic/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">Zizzo</a>, I've already got a source for my next heart failure:  my first ever with any character Storm of Unmagic, wandering around in the room I'm about to enter..  Oh, this does not look pleasant; it breathes disenchantment, which I don't resist.  Fortunately it doesn't breathe as I approach, and it appears to be nicely amenable to good old-fashioned bear-mauling&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
The rest of the level proceeds without incident.  Hmm, I just noticed that the INT bonus in bear form increased again when I gained clvl 44 (now maxed at +4, I believe), enough to push my INT above 18/200 for the first time&#8212;so my spell failure rate is now 0%. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15">  And I think I will head back up to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
where I stow sone potential swap-ins and stuff I'm stockpiling.  Hmm, I'm up to 17 Potions of Healing; I wonder if I should start carrying those instead of !oCCW's.  A quick trip to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to sell off loot, and then back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to prepare to return to LoM 56. 
</p>
<h4 id="head-4fdfe15be1b50d61294e4f3c3b0bbfc19f07e247">Part 4 of 9</h4>
<p>
Having finally caught up with some of the advice in the thread, I'm going to make a detour before returning to the dungeon:  at  <a class="external" href=".www.t-o-m-e.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=36058#36058"><img src="./wiki/classic/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">Atarlost's suggestion</a>, I'm going to return to Khazad-dum and start stocking up on Potions of Detonations. 
</p>
<p>
"Hmm, that's that town way up on top of the mountains, right?" 
</p>
<p>
Yep. 
</p>
<p>
"We're not gonna have to, like, go all the way through that Moria dungeon again to get to it, are we?" 
</p>
<p>
No, I think I've got a way to get there without messing up our recall status, <em>and</em> without having to use any Reset Recall scrolls, which means we can do it as many times as we want.  First we head cross-country to the entrance to the Moria entrance and descend to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>MoM 30</strong> 
</p>
<p>
After picking off a few nearby monsters, we recall to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wilderness</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"Uh, dude, the stairs were, like, right there; we could've just climbed out." 
</p>
<p>
But that wouldn't have reset the recall dungeon, which was the whole point. Now, when we cast Recall again, we go to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>MoM 50</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa, that's an excellent trick.  But what about those Righteous Mountains we were in before?  Will we have to go through them the long way now?" 
</p>
<p>
We can use the same trick to reset our recall status to where it was in the Sacred Land of Mountains. 
</p>
<p>
"Devious, dude." 
</p>
<p>
As you say. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  I probably should've powered us up into combat mode before doing this, though, as there's a pack of Cave orcs right next to me as I recall in&#8212;not to mention the Mirkwood spiders and Earth hounds I discover when I light up the room. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/attention.png" alt="<!>" height="15" width="15">  No problem, though.  After clearing those out, I cast Vision to find down stairs.  Hmm, there's a lesser vault (edfu) on the level.  Should I?  Well, there are some down stairs near it, so it's not really out of my way&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
The vault is mostly populated with Dreads, one of whom manages to knock my STR down a point&#8212;but he drops a Potion of Strength to restore it with. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  Nothing interesting therein, except: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Mage Staff of Fearran (+13,+11) (+0), with +0 spell power, sustain  WIS, flight and heavy curse 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Ooh, <em>there's</em> a keeper. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  And I just noticed that a Metal Cap I picked up from an Uruk Shaman back on MoM 30 is actually: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Metal Cap of Gonnol [+9], with radius-4 light, sustain CON and CHA,  hold life and resist cold 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Better, but still not worth toting around.  That done, we head to the down stairs and descend to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wilderness</strong> 
</p>
<p>
whence a short hop away is: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Khazad-dum</strong> 
</p>
<p>
The Mining Supply store has 4 Potions of Detonations in stock.  Clearly this is going to take a while&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15">  A quick sweep through the other stores finds nothing of particular interest, so we return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>MoM 50</strong> 
</p>
<p>
whence we recall to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wilderness</strong> 
</p>
<p>
and return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to stow the Potions of Detonation.  Clearly this is gonna take some time and stockpiling; I'll probably dip back to Khazad-dum every so often (and I'll try to be less verbose about it&#8230;).  Anyway, we use the same trick to return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 56</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like any other level."  Actually, the level looks more boring than most at first, until a few things happen.  First, my first Elder vampire with this character drops: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Ring Mail 'Belen' (-2) [+10], with sustain STR, DEX and CHA,  immunity to acid, and resist light, shards and disenchantment 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Not bad.  Then, as I'm entering the next room: 
</p>
<p>
<em>It breaths nether.</em> 
</p>
<p>
and there's a bright green Z in sight.  Sense Monsters reveals, yes, an approaching pack of Nether hounds&#8212;and, off to the north a bit, a cluster of Qs, including two Demonics, three Draconics and three Rottings. O-<em>kaaaay</em>, I think I'll be avoiding that part of the dungeon for a while. 
</p>
<p>
There is, alas, no convenient corner around which to ambush the Nether hounds, since they won't come out of the room, so I have to charge them. They knock me down to 575/819hp before I manage to take care of all of them. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, if I ever get a dog, remind me not to get one of those." 
</p>
<p>
I don't think that'll be a problem.  And speaking of non-problems, the rest of the level proceeds without incident.  Needless to say, I didn't go back and try my luck with the Qs. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  One toy picked up on the way: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Morning Star of Maning (+20,-1) (+4), with +4 STR and speed, frost  and poison brand, earthquakes, and slay orc, demon, Xundead and animal 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
which should sell for a bit.  Let's see how things go on: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 57</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You feel strangely lucky&#8230;"  A 3x1 small level, whose primary occupants of note are a pack of e's (mostly Beholders) and a pack of Time hounds. That's over quickly, and we proceed to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 58</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You like the look of this place&#8230;"  Even worse; a 1x1 small level, sporting an Old sorceror and some Dreads.  I take out the Old sorceror and have just started on the Dreads when guess what sneaks up on me?  Yep, <em>clvl 45</em> and the summons to the Maeglin quest. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa!  Where'd the giant bird rider dude come from?" 
</p>
<p>
"Brave warrior, Gondolin is being invaded, and we need your help.  Will you return with with me and aid us?" 
</p>
<p>
"Sure, no prob'.  Can I finish the level first, though?" 
</p>
<p>
"No, we must go now or it will be too late." 
</p>
<p>
"Really, it's just a little level, it won't take long&#8211;" 
</p>
<p>
It's okay, Bjorn, let's go. 
</p>
<p>
"But, like, what if there's something really cool on the level?" 
</p>
<p>
On a 1x1 level with a like-the-look-of feeling?  You're kidding, right? 
</p>
<p>
<em>(shrug)</em> "If you say so.  Let's go, then, giant bird rider dude." 
</p>
<p>
And <em>*poof*</em>, we're in: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gondolin</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<em>[looks around]</em> "Uh&#8230; so, like, where's the invasion, dude?" 
</p>
<p>
Oh, that's the Maeglin quest.  The entrance is over there, at the west of town. 
</p>
<p>
"Ah, so that's where the invaders will be coming in, then." 
</p>
<p>
No, the invasion doesn't start until we enter the quest. 
</p>
<p>
"&#8230;Wait a minute, dude, you mean this whole imminent invasion of Gondolin thing is just gonna sit there until we go down those stairs?" 
</p>
<p>
Right. 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/alert.png" alt="/!\" height="15" width="15"> <img src="./wiki/classic/img/angry.png" alt="X-(" height="15" width="15"> "Then, like, <em>why</em> was it so important for us to come back here in such an all-fired hurry?" 
</p>
<p>
Because if we hadn't come back with him then, the invasion <em>would</em> have happened, and Gondolin would've been destroyed. 
</p>
<p>
"But because we <em>did</em> come, the invasion won't happen until we go fight it." 
</p>
<p>
Yep.  We can even leave Gondolin and come back to take the quest later. 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15"> "Okay, I'm confused." 
</p>
<p>
Don't worry about it for now.  We're gonna have to power up quite a bit before we can do this quest; it's pretty tough. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, come on, it wasn't <em>that</em> bad&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Excuse me?  You barely got out with your life, and you're a frickin' <em><a class="external" href="./www.killerbunnies.org/angband/ladder/lil/lil_2.html"><img src="./wiki/classic/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">Alchemist</a></em>! 
</p>
<p>
"Now, I think you're exaggerating just a bit, hon.  I only lost a thousand hit points or so; I still had more than 1500 left.  Besides, I was only level 45, and I barely had half my equipment finished.  And it <em>was</em> your first time ever doing the quest, after all." 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, first and only so far. 
</p>
<p>
"Uh, &#8216;scuse me, black-n-white lady, but, like, I don't <em>have</em> a thousand or so hit points." 
</p>
<p>
Thank you, Bjorn, for making my point more eloquently than I could. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, I'm sure you'll do fine."  <em>[scratches Bjorn between the ears and leaves]</em> 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, that was pretty condesective of her, wasn't it?" 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, I'm beginning to think all that power is starting to go to her head. 
</p>
<p>
"You said it, dude.  She <em>is</em> pretty hot, though." 
</p>
<p>
Well, yeah, a +22 total bonus to CHA will do that.  Which reminds me, we've got skill points to allocate:  1 to Bearform-combat, 1 to Temporal and 3 to Spell-power.  My unhasted speed in bear form drops to -14, but Essence of Speed is up to spell effect level 54, so my top speed stays at +26.  Say, as long as we're in Gondolin, maybe we should do the house quest here. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, <em>another</em> house?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, the others <em>are</em> getting kinda full.  <em>[checks notes]</em>  Hmm, no, we need to prepare for this one. 
</p>
<p>
"Why?" 
</p>
<p>
It's just one big empty area, with no ambush corners.  We'd have to take on the dragons in the open, all at once. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa, heinous.  Good call, dude." 
</p>
<p>
From here we head to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to sell off the randart Morning Star and stow the randart Ring Mail.  As long as I'm in the neighborhood, I think I'll take a side trip to Khazad-dum.  On the way, I encounter another odd vaultish thing on MoM 50, this one looking like it was carved straight out of the mountains:

</pre>This is after I cleaned it out and destroyed all the traps that filled most of the interior.  Whatever it is, it nets a Potion of Constitution, maxing my CON at 18/200, <img src="./wiki/classic/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> and: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
  The Chain Mail of Andil (-32,-65) [+13](40%), with +40% hit points,  sustain CHA, immunity to acid and lightning, and resist fire and chaos 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
I'm thinking&#8230; no.  Finally moving on to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Khazad-dum</strong> 
</p>
<p>
the Mining Supply store has 12 Potions of Detonations and a Feanorian Lamp of the Magi (+3) with spell-store and resist nether.  I'll probably never be able to use it, but I'll kick myself if I don't buy it&#8230;  I stop by: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to sell off a saleable weapon I picked up (which is becoming more important, now that I'm buying Potions of Detonations in bulk); on the way, I acquire a fate to meet a Village idiot on dlvl 14. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  That reminds me, as long as I'm here, I've got a couple silly dlvl-1 fates I should pick off.  I also buy a Potion of Wisdom from the Black Market.  One more of those should max me.  Home, then, to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
and we'll save it here for now.  Remind me next time, Bjorn, we'll need to reset our recall dungeon before returning to the Land of Mountains. 
</p>
<p>
"&#8216;Kay." 
</p>
<h4 id="head-c3b6778325572fe7812cff20eded5be68dbfc2fe">Part 5 of 9</h4>
<p>
"Dude, don't forget, we've gotta reset the recall thing." 
</p>
<p>
Right.  Cross-country and down to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 45</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  Hmm, there's a lesser vault (serpent) across the level from me; I suppose I should go do it.  It's populated mostly by Half-trolls and Air hounds, with a couple dragons and&#8230; hmm, that junkart is moving.  <em>[checks visible-monsters window]</em>  Ah, apparently it's Emperor Mimic in disguise. 
</p>
<p>
"Don't you mean&#8230; wait, didn't we&#8230; aw, man, not again&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Heh.  It's in the outer ring of the vault; I head back out the loop to the entrance and wait to ambush it.  It drops: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Toenail of Vecna, which activates for ruination 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Well, it certainly didn't do Emperor Mimic any good&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  The rest of the vault nets nothing of interest; we recall from there to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wilderness</strong> 
</p>
<p>
and back down to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 58</strong>, take 2 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like any other level."  No, actually, it looks exactly like the 1x1 level we got yanked out of to go to Gondolin.  I mean <em>exactly</em>; some of the rubble is positioned differently, but the layout seems exactly the same.  The monsters aren't as interesting, though&#8230; well, maybe that Storm of Unmagic on the west side. 
</p>
<p>
The level goes quickly, netting a Potion of Intelligence and a Ring of Extra Attacks (+2)&#8212;no better than what I've got now, but it should sell for a lot.  That Storm of Unmagic got in a couple time breaths this time, but hey, that's what I'm carrying the restoration junkart for.  Pushing on, then, to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 59</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  Hmm, there's a vault nearby, in the northwest corner.  On the way thereto, I hear fighting. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, is that Gramps again?" 
</p>
<p>
No, this time it looks like Fundin Bluecloak.  He's harmless. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, one of those bearded short dudes.  Hey, what's up?" 
</p>
<p>
"Zounds!  A bear who speaks man-style.  Perchance art thou of the lineage of the legendary Beorn?" 
</p>
<p>
"Yep, he's my Gramps.  Even <em>he</em> doesn't call himself 'legendary,' though." 
</p>
<p>
"In my homeland, the werebear Beorn is deemed naught but a children's tale; it is truly enlightening to meet aught of his kin in the flesh.  What brings thee, then, into these sacred mountains?  Dost thou also toil against the legions of the Evil One?" 
</p>
<p>
"Yep, I'm a mighty Warper, goin' around slaying evil dudes.  Some day I'm gonna vanquish Morgoth himself." 
</p>
<p>
"O ho!  Thy ambition is mayhap overlarge, but thy cause is noble.  So be it, then; we shall return each to our own honorable quests, and mayhap our paths shall cross again." 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, see ya."  Fundin wanders off. <em>[Yes, I dismissed him.  What's your point? -ed]</em>  "Dude, what was with that guy and all his 'thous' and 'mayhaps' and stuff?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, he is a priest, and a Dwarven one, no less; it's not too surprising that the translation to English might come out a bit strained. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa.  Remind me not to become a priest, then.  Wait&#8212;aw, man, I should'a asked him what was so sacred about these mountains." 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> As before, the vault isn't so much a vault as a maze-like room carved right out of the mountains.  It nets a Potion of Wisdom, maxing me at 18/140 WIS, <img src="./wiki/classic/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> a Potion of Intelligence, bringing me within one more potion of max, and a chest that had in it: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Demonshield of Gothmog [13,+13] (+4), with +4 DEX, invisibility,  sustain STR, DEX and CON, free action, hold life, levitation, fire aura and  auto-curse 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Okay, this is getting ridiculous.  If you're not interested in the priesthood, Bjorn, how about a last-minute career change to Demonologist? 
</p>
<p>
"Uh, I think I'll pass, dude." 
</p>
<p>
Heh. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  The level is rather pedestrian for a while, with the exception of a treasure pit near the south edge of the level. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa, the walls, the swords, even the <em>money</em> is attacking us.  Dude, I hope this isn't a flasback from those mushrooms&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  Hmm, this must be where demons start becoming more common; Sense Monsters is picking up a pack of Barbazu in a parallel corridor to my south, and a flock of assorted demons to my northeast, including a Lesser Balrog and a Nycadaemon.  An Ethereal dragon joins in the fun as I try to set up tactical position.  Except for a few slip-ups, though (like a Marilith getting summoned by a Hezrou I let into line of sight), the assault is fairly straightforward. 
</p>
<p>
Before I can check out the loot, though, I'm lured north by a pack of Nexus hounds&#8212;and amongst all the purple Zs I detect a purple H&#8212;namely, Baphomet the Minotaur Lord.  <em>[checks notes]</em>  Hmm, 3500hp, +20 speed, some nasty spells and force breath, <em>brutal</em> melee damage&#8230; enh, I think we can take him.  Whaddaya say, Bjorn? 
</p>
<p>
"Let's rock his horns, dude.  Halt, you evil walking cow guy!" 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  He has me worried after the first turn, as I only take him down two stars and he gets in 100hp worth of return attacks; two more turns, though, and he's down, dropping a bunch of junk.  Now back through the demons' loot&#8230; nothing of interest, except: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Gamenlon's Summoning Manual, which activates for confusion 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
and that isn't really of interest either, now that I think about it. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15"> The rest of the level passes without much incident, beyond encountering my first Eye druj in a four-subroom pit room.  Fortunately, he's right by the subroom door at an angle, so I can pick him of with knight's-move Manathrusts.  A Mature green dragon in another subroom drops: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Long Bow of Bard (x5) (+17,+19) (+2), with +2 DEX, luck and might,  free action and sense dragons 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
There's some irony in there somewhere&#8230; nah, it would've been ironic if Smaug had dropped it.  Let's move on, then: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 60</strong> 
</p>
<p>
All together now:  "You have a superb feeling about this level." <img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  A little early excitement when I detect the beginnings of a Greater wall monster infestation.  Fortunately, as before, it was fomenting in a rather small room with only one exit, so I could contain and finish it before it got out of control. 
</p>
<p>
And yes, that was the highlight of the 'superb' level.  Let's try again on: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 61</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<em>[insert 'superb level' joke here]</em>  Just for the variety, this level seems to have some destroyed areas.  I'm gonna have to top off Thrain's wand when we get out of here.  The interesting inhabitants of this level are an assorted pack of hounds:  mostly Vibration hounds, some Plasma hounds, and a Water hound or two just for spice.  Fortunately I spotted them in advance with Sense Monsters, soon enough to find a convenient corner around which to ambush them.  Between them, they take me to <em>clvl 46</em>, with skill points going 1 to Bearform-combat, 1 to Temporal, 2 to Spell-power and 1 to Prayer.  That's everything but Prayer maxed now. Essence of Speed tops off at spell effect level 56, bringing my top speed up to +27 (it will go back down to +26 when I hit clvl 50, though). Manathrust tops out at spell effect level 21, doing 24d9 damage (average 120).  Noxious Cloud finally hits spell effect level 30 and switches to unbreath damage (at 98 points per turn; not too shabby).  And I'm only one skill level in Prayer away from getting Manwe's Call.  Oh, and let's not forget, with Bearform-combat topped off, I'm up to 17 attacks per turn. 
</p>
<p>
Hmm, my pack is getting full; with the rest of the 'superb' level complete, I think we should return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Loth</strong><tt>^H^H^H^H</tt><strong>Wilderness</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Ah yes, small downside to the Recall trick.  No problem; just a quick cross-country jaunt to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
where I stow some stockpile stuff.  Oh, I forgot to *ID* a junkart: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Gem of Venom, which activates for cure stun 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Enh.  I need to head to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Minas Anor</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to stow Gothmog and Bard; from there to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to sell off loot.  On the way there, I acquire a fate to find something special on dlvl 1. 
</p>
<p>
"Now, that's what I call timing, dude." 
</p>
<p>
And a better fate than most; it nets: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Cleaver 'Thromegon' (+10,+2) (+2), with +2 CHA, acid brand, chaotic  effects, and slay Xdragon, giant, demon, evil and animal 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
I was hoping for a randart armor or a randart ring, actually, but at least this will sell for a bit.  And as long as we're out and about, we might as well do a molotov run.  MoM 50 is uneventful this time through, but in: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Khazad-dum</strong> 
</p>
<p>
the Mining Supply Store only has one Potion of Detonations.  Ah well.  On my way back through MoM 50, my Vision scan discovers something odd:  a Glabrezu raw meat. 
</p>
<p>
"Uh, dude, how do you get meat out of a demon?" 
</p>
<p>
I think, Bjorn, that that's a question we really don't want know the answer to. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah.  Bet it tastes like chicken, though.  Wanna go find out?" 
</p>
<p>
I'm thinking, no.  Home again to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to prepare for our return to LoM 61. 
</p>
<h4 id="head-7d813462b686d27aed9cec1f5cf9e0814c8873f4">INTERMISSION:  A-Questing We Will Go...</h4>
<p>
Off we go again&#8211; 
</p>
<p>
"Wait, didn't you say you need to charge up the wall-blaster thing?" 
</p>
<p>
Ah, right, after that destroyed level, it needs it.  A quick detour to the Wizards' Spire, then, and <em>now</em> we're off to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>MoM 50</strong> 
</p>
<p>
??? Oh, yeah, I forgot to reset that&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/redface.png" alt=":o" height="15" width="15">  I clean up a few nearby monsters and am about to leave when Sense Monsters detects none other than Ren the Unclean. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa, <em>déjà vu</em>." 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, the other Bjorn killed Ren once.  And I think we'll do it the same way; there's a wall segment in a nearby room that I can make a pillar out of.  Just gotta clear out that Nalfeshnee first, though&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
After a bit of setup, Ren falls fairly quickly; unfortunately, he does get a hit in on me, giving me the Black Breath.  Well, I <em>was</em> headed back anyway&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa, <em>déjà vu</em> again." 
</p>
<p>
Don't you mean&#8211; 
</p>
<p>
"It's like I've had this feeling of <em>vujà dé</em> before, dude&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Um&#8230; yeah.  Anyway, back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Hmm, I only have four Sprigs of Athelas left in my stockpile after eating this one; I hope this doesn't happen too often&#8230;  Anyway, a side trip to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to mathom: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Ren's first ring, with +2 INT and infravision, invisibility, resist  fear, blindness and nexus, drain exp, heavy curse and curse-no-drop 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
I've only got room for one Nazgul ring each; I suppose I'll just ditch duplicate rings.  Say, as long as we're in Bree, I know how we can get some more Athelas. 
</p>
<p>
"How?  There wasn't any in that pawn shop place." 
</p>
<p>
There's a quest we can take in Bree whose reward is a stash of Athelas. First, though, we have to do the: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wight Grave</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Huh?  Oh yeah, that's right, my Magic skill <em>is</em> higher than my Combat skill, isn't it? <img src="./wiki/classic/img/redface.png" alt=":o" height="15" width="15">  I keep forgetting Bjorn isn't actually a warrior-type.  <em>[checks notes]</em> Hmm, the Wight King has some nasty spells, but I think we can take him, especially with our speed advantage. A quick power-up and in we go&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, this is it?  Just a small cave and a couple wimpy monsters?" 
</p>
<p>
No, there are more caves, connected by void gates; we've got to find our way to the one with the Wight King in it&#8230; or, now that I think of it, we could just cast Sense Monsters and Recall-swap with a conveniently placed monster next to the Wight King&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15">  I choose an Emperor wight that's positioned near a cubby-hole that I can duck into as soon as I land. 
</p>
<p>
And the battle is downright anti-climactic.  I land next to the Wight King and two more Emperor wights, who can't even touch me with Wind Shield up. The Wight King goes down in one turn, without ever getting a hit on me; the Emperor wights take another turn each, and the rest of the wights in the cave fall to a couple Globes of Light.  Of course, with the quest completed, the only void gate out of this cave has been replaced with the exit stairs, which means I can't get to any of the other caves except via Recall-swap&#8230; nah, let 'em rot.  I return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
with my prize: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Filthy Rag of the Wight [1,-1](40%) (+2), with +2 INT and  searching, +40% mana, resist blindness and confusion, vulnerability to  fire, see invisible and heavy curse 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
The mana boost would be nice, but the paucity of resists and the vulnerability to fire speak against it.  I'll stow it, after I do the: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dark Horseman quest</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Heads up, Bjorn, there's Uvatha, on the north side of the Temple building. We'll be in his line of sight as soon as I step off the Mayor's office door; we'll need to make a run for cover&#8230; wait a minute&#8230; <em>[checks notes]</em>  Uvatha doesn't have any spells or breath attacks.  What am I worried about?  Charge him, Bjorn. 
</p>
<p>
"Right.  Halt, you spooky evil ghost thing!" 
</p>
<p>
I clearly left these quests too long.  Uvatha is a total wuss; he's stunned solid after one turn of attacks and dead (temporarily) after two.  He drops nothing of note, besides: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Uvatha's first ring, with +5 CON and searching, invisibility, sustain  DEX, resist poison and disenchantment, levitation, drain exp, heavy curse  and curse-no-drop 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Hrm, that's right, I bought the last Scroll of *Remove Curse* from the Bree temple to get rid of Ren's ring.  Quick side trip, then, to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gondolin</strong> 
</p>
<p>
which has just what I need.  Back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to stow Uvatha's ring and pick up my Athelas.  And as long as I'm picking off quests, I've got a Wand of Digging burning a hole in my pack; where's Melinda Proudfoot? <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Maz 25</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<em>[casts Sense Monsters]</em> Nope, no Merton here.  <em>[casts Reveal Ways]</em> Hmm, that's annoying; the detected doors and stairs vanish almost immediately.  Maze special effect, presumably.  &#8216;Sokay, I remember I saw some down stairs right over here, just past this wall.. <em>*zap*</em> 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Maz 26</strong> 
</p>

"Hey, like, how are we gonna get this Merton kid home, anyway?  I don't think I can carry him back." 
</p>
<p>
We just give him this ?oWoR that I&#8230; forgot to buy in Bree. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/redface.png" alt=":o" height="15" width="15"> &#8216;Scuse me for a moment:

"You feel that you will meet your fate here."

</p>
<p>
Let's see&#8230; <em>[checks character dump]</em> Ah yes, to find a Scroll of Door/Stair Location on dlvl 27. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, yeah.  Totally lame, as always." 
</p>
<p>
Indeed.  Sense Monsters detects&#8230; eleven Mertons?  No, those are Dark elven warlocks.  I think I'll pick them off just for the loot.  <em>[sound F/X:  Dark elven warlocks dying painfully]</em>  Well, that was a waste of time.  Let's try this fast-forward thing again, then:

"A Scroll of&#8211;?  Oh, thank you, noble one!"  Merton reads the ?oWoR and vanishes. 
</p>
<p>
"Cute kid, but he shouldn't have been playing around in, like, dangerous mazes without a go-home scroll." 
</p>
<p>
<em>(shrug)</em> He probably lost his.  Say, as long as we're in the Maze, maybe we should take out the Minotaur at the bottom. 
</p>
<p>
"What, that Bafoom guy?  I thought we already killed him." 
</p>
<p>
No, not Baphomet.  This is a different Minotaur. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh.  How far's the bottom?" 
</p>
<p>
Just another five levels, and we're punching through them pretty quickly. 
</p>
<p>
"Let's do it, then." 
</p>
<p>
That's the spirit.  Fast forward to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Maz 37</strong> 
</p>
<p>
And there's the Minotaur, on the west edge of the level. 
</p>
<p>
"Right.  Halt, you evil walking cow guy!  I've already kicked your boss's butt, and I shalt smite you even harder!  Um&#8230; just gimme a minute to, like, find you in this maze and stuff&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
No need; he's awake and has found a straight path to us.  I bring Manwe's Blessing and Wind Shield back up&#8230; and he falls in a single turn. 
</p>
<p>
"Ha!  Told ya I was gonna smite your butt, dude." 
</p>
<p>
And back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
with our prize: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Steel Helm of Hammerhand [+20] (+3), which grants berzerk power and  has +3 STR, DEX and CON, sustain STR, DEX and CON, resist fear, acid, cold,  dark and nexus, and slow digestion 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Not bad, if we could wear it.  Now off to give Melinda the good news. 
</p>
<p>
"Man, I didn't have the heart to tell her that we already, like, had one of the go-home knobs." 
</p>
<p>
&#8216;Sokay, we did a good deed, that's its own reward. 
</p>
<p>
"That's the spirit, dude." 
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, I certainly won't turn down this Potion of Experience from the Bree Black Market. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  At this level, it just trims a bit off the top, but everything helps.  Let's see, I need to take a side trip to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Minas Anor</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to stow these artifacts, and then back home to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
where the Black Market has <em>another</em> Potion of Experience, <em>and</em> a Potion of Intelligence, which finally maxes my INT, the last of my unmaxed stats, at 18/170. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> <img src="./wiki/classic/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15">  Oh, and an Indestructible Ring of Speed (+11) that I can't afford.  See, that's why we need to keep collecting saleable loot, Bjorn. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh.  &#8216;Kay." 
</p>
<p>
That reminds me, after our adventures in the Maze, Thrain's wand is down to 57 charges from 100; a quick trip to the Wizards' Spire fixes that.  Next time out, back to the Land of Mountains.  And Bjorn, I guess you're going to have to remind me again to reset the recall dungeon next time out. 
</p>
<p>
"No prob', dude."

<p>
As long as I'm on a roll, I think I'll do some more quests.  Let's try out our Potions of Detonations in the: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Spiders quest</strong> 
</p>
<p>
which turns out to be embarrassingly easy when you're faster than all the spiders, have Sense Monsters and a level-30 Noxious Cloud, do ungodly amounts of melee damage per turn, and most importantly, can fly. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, yeah, just rub it in, Human&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Oh, believe you me, <a class="external" href="./www.killerbunnies.org/angband/ladder/gath/gath_2.html"><img src="./wiki/classic/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">Gathraka</a>, I'm itching for a rematch on that front myself.  Next time we'll just have to remember to save a Ring of Flying for this eventuality. 
</p>
<p>
"Mm, right, 'next time'.  Which will be, what, sometime in the Fifth or Sixth Age?" 
</p>
<p>
Hey, you never know.  Maybe I'll set you up for the next DitL. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, yeah, that's <em>exactly</em> what I need is a bunch of people laughing over my every mistake." 
</p>
<p>
Don't worry, you can just blame all your mistakes on me. 
</p>
<p>
"I already do that." 
</p>
<p>
Somehow I'm not surprised&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  Anyway, we've got a reward to pick up. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa!  Dude, this would've been <em>really</em> handy about a dungeon or so ago." 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, sorry; I tend to be overcautious about the quests sometimes.  Let's take this to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to sell it off.  Back in: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
I stow the !oDet's for now.  Those worked out even better than I'd hoped: it turns out that in addition to doing 25d25 damage on impact if they hit, they also explode for a radius-2 shard ball, doing <em>another</em> 25d25 damage at the center whether they hit or not.  I managed to take out an Elder aranea with just one of the potions.  When I go back to the dungeons, I'll definitely be taking a few of these with me to soften up the tough uniques before closing to melee.  In the meantime, though, there's another quest that I don't usually do, but I think I can manage it with Bjorn: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Poison Water quest</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"My goodness, you <em>are</em> flinchy about these quests, aren't you?  That quest was a cakewalk, as I recall." 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, <a class="external" href="./www.killerbunnies.org/angband/ladder/lil/lil_2.html"><img src="./wiki/classic/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">Lil</a>, that's because you were packing an overclocked Wand of Noxious Cloud with something like twenty gazillion charges.  Which is why I think Bjorn and his Noxious Cloud spell can handle it.  And there's nothing wrong with being cautious about quests. 
</p>
<p>
"Well, yes, considering your little Orc friend's recent performance, I suppose you do have a point." 
</p>
<p>
"<em>Vrasubatlat!</em>  That's it, lemme at the bitch!" 
</p>
<p>
"Hon, you can't even <em>touch</em> me with that little pigsticker." <em>*whish*</em> 
</p>
<p>
All right, break it up, you two.  Lil, apologize. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, all right, I suppose that was a bit out of line.  I'm sorry, Gath, I'm sure you'll do better next time." 
</p>
<p>
"Hmph.  Fine, whatever.  (grmbl muttter stuck-up <em>kurv</em>&#8230;)" 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, just because <em>you</em> can't get any with that face&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
"What was that?!" 
</p>
<p>
Both of you, out, <em>now</em>! <img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  You see what I have to put up with. 
</p>
<p>
"Aw, man, why &#8216;dja break &#8216;em up?  That was shaping up to be a righteous catfight!  I got popcorn and everything." 
</p>
<p>
Come on, Bjorn, we've got a quest to do. 
</p>
<p>
"Ooh, someone's grouchy&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/angry.png" alt="X-(" height="15" width="15"> <em>Any</em>-way&#8230;  The quest site turns out to be in the corner of the inverted 'L'.  I forgot to check the time of day when I headed off on the quest, so it takes me into the early evening to finish it; but darkness is no obstacle, and with a bit of patience and perserverance (and a possibly excessive degree of caution), the quest falls without incident. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, can we, like, not cast that spell again for a while? I can still smell it&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Indeed.  The reward armor has resist base plus resists shards, which is a strict subset of what Arvedui already has, so it's redundant.  Let's see, I think the armor store with the highest cap is in: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
And as long as we're in the neighborhood, we might as well do a run to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Khazad-dum</strong> 
</p>
<p>
where the Mining Supply store has 3!oDet.  A quick trip home to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to stow these and I'm back off to: 
</p>
<h4 id="head-ee9dc79fb5e56955509bf116e479651fad0e2639">Part 6 of 9</h4>
<p>
<strong>LoM 61</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like any other level."  Sense Monsters is detecting Uriel&#8212;and I just remembered I was supposed to bring some !oDet's&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15">  Uriel is awake and approaching as I punch through a corridor full of Cave trolls in his direction.  Fortunately, he ends up stuck in a blind corner, which will give me a chance to lure him out.  Okay, this could be tough, Bjorn; above all else, we don't want him to breathe on us. 
</p>
<p>
"Why?  Has he got, like, really bad breath or something?" 
</p>
<p>
Really <em>hot</em> breath, more like:  fire and plasma, strong enough to do some pretty serious damage to us, even through our fire resistance. 
</p>
<p>
"Right.  Halt, you very good evildoer!" 
</p>
<p>
That's the other annoying part, Uriel is good, so this will be a piety hit. Oh well, my piety's up above 90000, I'm not too worried.  Okay, let's do this. 
</p>
<p>
After one turn, he's down two stars and I'm down to 747/922hp after a plazma breath.  On the second turn, he summons a Seraph in the corridor behind us.  @#$%&#8230; leave it for now.  Another four turns and Uriel bleeds to death, with me at 550/922hp and the Seraph untouched.  Fortunately the Seraph is a pushover, falling in two turns and barely touching me.  A quick sweep over Uriel's drop yields nothing of interest. 
</p>
<p>
Hmm, Shadowfax is approaching us from the south; I teleport him away. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, why didn't you just teleport the very hot angel guy away?" 
</p>
<p>
Because Uriel has ranged attacks and could peg us from offscreen. Shadowfax is harmless as long as he's not next to you. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh.  &#8216;Kay." 
</p>
<p>
Let's see, a quick Sense Monsters and&#8230; whoa.  There's an animal pit off to our northeast, with five Demonic Qs, four Dracolisks and four Nether hounds in it (not to mention two Jackals and two Scruffy little dogs&#8212;just for the comedic value, presumably&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15"> ).  I think we'll be avoiding that general area. 
</p>
<p>
The level is pretty straightforward for a while, until I encounter my first Nightwing down the southeast corner of the level.  The approach was down a straight corridor, which was probably a mistake, as he woke up and gave me a good psychic smack to the head.  I Phase Door out to a nearby corridor and try to lure him out, but he won't come.  Man, I'd like to take him out, but I don't want to try the straight approach again&#8230; enh, leave him. 
</p>
<p>
Back west and north a ways, it looks like some of the contents of that animal pit have leaked out.  Hmm, I've got a decent ambush position here just beside the north entrance of a room; let's see what I can take out. I hold my own for a while, taking out one of the Dracolisks, until: 
</p>
<p>
<em>It magically summons an undead adversary!</em> 
</p>
<p>
Huh?  Oh, there's an Undead beholder approaching the room from a corridor out the south exit.  Hmm, I think I've got the worst of the leak; I think it's safe to slip to the south edge of the room and smack it down.  More hounds approaching from the north as I retake my ambush position; I drop a Noxious Cloud in their path to pick them off as they enter.  And I notice that the Dracolisk dropped: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Short Sword 'Gilettar' (+3,+7) (+2), with +2 attacks, slay animal,  resist disenchantment, see invisible, slow digestion and regeneration. 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Enh, it's one of the 'official' ones, I'll take it up and stow it. 
</p>
<p>
Pushing in further, I catch another of the escaped Dracolisks, then push further west to a checkerboard pit, wherein a Spectral Ancient white dragon drops: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Spear 'Aeglos' (3d6) (+15,+25) [+5] (+4), which activates for  lightning ball (100) every 500 turns and has radius-1 light, +4 WIS and  DEX, lightning and frost brand, slay orc, troll, giant and Xundead, free  action, resist lightning, cold and light, slow digestion and blessed 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/attention.png" alt="<!>" height="15" width="15">  I think I'm gonna start running out of room in Minas Anor before long&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
I avoid the animal-pit area and head south, encountering an Ancient multi-hued dragon who drops two Bronze Dragon Scale Mails, one of them Polished. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/attention.png" alt="<!>" height="15" width="15">  First one of those I've seen, I think. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, I can see my face in this thing.  And it's <em>way</em> better tanned than I am." 
</p>
<p>
Um&#8230; yeah.  Finally, in the middle of the level, I find a lesser vault (nethack, spiral rooms) with a Dracolich and a Master mystic inside.  My approach is from the northwest corner of the vault; I poke a hole in with Thrain's wand and take on the first comer, which of course is the Dracolich.  He does manage to hit me for an exp drain, but apparently not for much, because killing him pushes me over the top to <em>clvl 47</em>, with all five skill points going to Prayer (as they will for the rest of the levels).  Manwe's Call is now available at spell effect level 22, summoning level-51 Great eagles.  <em>[checks notes]</em> Hmm, +28 speed, 158AC, average 424hp&#8230; let's see what one of these babies can do. 
</p>
<p>
"Right.  <em>By the power of god dude Manwe, I summon a mighty eagle!</em>" 
</p>
<p>
<em>The Great eagle gets angry!  The Great eagle cries out in pain.</em> 
</p>
<p>
Oh, @#$%, did I leave a Noxious Cloud effect going around here?  Well, crap, I guess I'll just have to kill it, then. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/sad.png" alt=":(" height="15" width="15"> <img src="./wiki/classic/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15">  The vault goes okay for a while, until I make the mistake of approaching the Master mystic down a straight shot along the north wall and giving him a chance to summon Araneas behind me.  But this time, my tactical options have improved; I Recall-swap with a Red dragon bat near the middle of the vault, neatly getting out of everyone's line of sight&#8212;okay, except for the Novice paladin, who I just charm.  From there, I can head back out to the west edge and take on the Araneas one on one, and they fall quickly. 
</p>
<p>
The Master mystic, on the other hand, seems to be pinned behind a sleeping Acidic cytoplasm, so I cross through the middle of the vault to the east side and ambush him there.  The rest of the vault is pretty straightfoward, and nets nothing of interest beyond&#8230; wait for it&#8230; The Crumpled Scroll of Mass Resurrection. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/alert.png" alt="/!\" height="15" width="15">  Not that I'd use it, but it makes a great souvenir. 
</p>
<p>
"Why?  What's it do?" 
</p>
<p>
It would resurrect all the uniques you've killed, and you'd have to kill them again. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, I can barely keep track of which of those guys I've killed and which I haven't with all this mushroom flashback business.  I don't need that kind of confusion." 
</p>
<p>
That's not a mushroom flashback, Bjorn, that's the sanity hit from that Nightwing.  In fact, my pack is getting full, so let's go home and fix that: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Just five of my rather large stockpile of !oCLIns is enough to fix my sanity problems.  And with that taken care of&#8230; let's see, first down to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Minas Anor</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to stow the artifacts.  And that's my third house full; I may have to do the Gondolin house quest cold if this keeps up.  From there, up to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to sell off some loot.  From there, back home to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Back to the Land of Mountains next time.  And this time, the recall dungeon is right, so you don't need to remind me next time, Bjorn. 
</p>
<p>
"&#8216;Kay." 
</p>
<h4 id="head-a16be3d041f242fde810a74b099498aeca3c2fc3">INTERMISSION:  Hard Core</h4>
<p>
"Dude, don't not forget to&#8230; not reset&#8230; aw, dang, I wasn't supposed to remind you of that, was I?" 
</p>
<p>
That's okay, it reminds me of something else I need you to remind me of: when we go back to the Sacred Land of Mountains, remind me to take a couple !oDet's. 
</p>
<p>
"&#8216;Kay&#8230; so I'm s'posed to remind you to remind me not to remind you&#8230;" <img src="./wiki/classic/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15">  "Wait, aren't we going back to the righteous mountains now?" 
</p>
<p>
No, I think we should go do the Gondolin house quest now. 
</p>
<p>
"I thought we need that wand of go-directly-to-jail or whatever." 
</p>
<p>
I think I've got a way to do it without the Wand of Stone Prison.  Good thing I didn't sell off my old Tome of the Time; I'm going to use the Banishment spell out of it. 
</p>
<p>
"But, like, didn't you say you didn't need that spell?" 
</p>
<p>
Normally I wouldn't. Banishment is basically a combination of Teleport Away and a suspend spell&#8212;which actually doesn't work anyway as I read the code, since everything gets teleported away before the suspend effect can be applied, so it's effectively just a duplicate of the Teleport Away spell.  In this case, though, the dragons can't be teleported out of my line of sight (assuming they can be teleported at all on a quest level), so the suspend effect should catch them all&#8212;and if I'm lucky, that will give me enough time to take out the most dangerous ones. 
</p>
<p>
"Sounds cool.  Let's do it, dude." 
</p>
<p>
Okay, besides the Tome, I should take some !oHeal&#8230; and I think I'll take a couple !oDet's too, just in case.  And now, off to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gondolin</strong> 
</p>
<p>
where I pick up a Potion of Resistance from the Black Market before heading into the: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dragons quest</strong> 
</p>
<p>
which turns out to be utterly anticlimactic:  nothing tougher than a Mature gold, and contrary to my preliminary information, there <em>are</em> some random mountain squares present as cover.  I don't even bother casting Banishment.  Man, maybe Lil is right; maybe I <em>am</em> getting overcautious about these quests. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, I dunno, dude.  We've still got that whole invading army thing, that sounds pretty tough." 
</p>
<p>
You know, Bjorn, you're right.  Let me stow a couple things in our new house, and then strap yourself in, because we're about to take the: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Invasion of Gondolin quest</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa, this passage is like a maze!  Dude, I think I'm lost." 
</p>
<p>
We're okay; turn left here.  This is part of Gondolin's defenses, actually; other than us and Turgon, only Maeglin knows how to get back up these passages to Gondolin from where the invading army is. 
</p>
<p>
"No way, dude; surely he woulda' filled in all his badguy commanders and stuff." 
</p>
<p>
But then they wouldn't need him any more&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"And they'd prob'ly&#8230; ouch, good point.  So you're saying if we, like, off this Mangled dude, then this whole big army won't even be able to get to Gondolin and they'll be, like, stuck there?" 
</p>
<p>
All armored up and no place to invade&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
"Excellent!  Total humiliation!  But wait, why couldn't they just come in the front way like we do?" 
</p>
<p>
Um&#8230; let me get back to you on that. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, did I see you leaving the exploding potion things back at the house?" 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, I stowed the !oDet's for now. 
</p>
<p>
"Why?" 
</p>
<p>
You're about to find out; we just ran into the invaders. 
</p>
<p>
"Man, what lamers, they put their wimpy orc guys right on the front line&#8230; uh, dude, why are they, like, wearing dynamite?" 
</p>
<p>
Snaga sappers.  Noxious Cloud them fast, before they detonate on us. 
</p>
<p>
"Right." <em>*FOOSH*</em> "Ah!  Dude, they're exploding anyway!" 
</p>
<p>
I was afraid of that; looks like they detonate when they attack <em>or</em> when they die.  That's why I stowed the !oDet's; one of those explosions might have touched them off. 
</p>
<p>
"Good call, dude.  Now what?" 
</p>
<p>
Cast Sense Monsters, we need to find Maeglin. 
</p>
<p>
"&#8216;Kay, let's see&#8230; got him, way over there in the far corner." 
</p>
<p>
And a Master mindcrafter right next to him.  Perfect, Recall-swap with him. 
</p>
<p>
"Right&#8230; dude, I can't target him!" 
</p>
<p>
Hrm, we can't move off the current screen with the Recall targeting, and Maeglin's a screen up.  Okay, we'll have to do this in stages; target the Ancient red dragon in the middle of the level. 
</p>
<p>
"Got it." <em>*bamf*</em> "Dang, now I lost the Master mental case." 
</p>
<p>
It's okay, cast Sense Monsters again&#8230; there he is.  Okay, Bjorn, take us in. 
</p>
<p>
"Right." <em>*bamf*</em> "Halt, you evil traitor!  Hizonner the mighty King dude Turgon has sent me to, like, smite you righteously upside the head really hard!" 
</p>
<p>
Um, actually, Maeglin smites <em>us</em> as we swap in, taking us from 840/940hp down to 756.  And he's almost as fast as us.  <em>And</em> a Lesser balrog just punched through the wall to join the party.  Hoo boy. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, &#8216;least this quest won't be anti-climatical." 
</p>
<p>
Heh.  One turn later, Maeglin's down two stars and I'm at 681/940hp. Second turn, he's down four stars and I'm at 635/940hp, and the Lesser balrog moves in next to me.  Time to toss back a !oHeal&#8212;and luckily, that's the turn Maeglin missed.  Unluckily, I just noticed I quaffed one of my !oCCW's instead of the !oHeal's, and in the turn it takes me to correct the error, Maeglin and the balrog knock me back down to 850/940hp. 
</p>
<p>
"Don't sweat it, dude, we can take this guy!" 
</p>
<p>
Oh, I'm not giving up yet.  Another turn, he's down to three stars and I'm down to 799/940hp.  And again, he's at two stars, I'm at 746/940hp&#8212;and the @#$%ing Lesser balrog summons a pack of Vrocks behind me. 
</p>
<p>
"We've got him on the ropes now!  One more turn should do it!" 
</p>
<p>
And it does!  Maeglin is down.  Now, can I afford to stick around and see what he dropped?  We'll need to get rid of this Lesser balrog and his Vrocks first.  I wonder if Teleport Away works here&#8230; yes!  A quick sweep to pick up the loot, and it's time to slip out of here.  Okay, Bjorn, Recall-swap with that Ancient black dragon at seven-o'clock. 
</p>
<p>
"Which one?" 
</p>
<p>
The one furthest away from us. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, right." <em>*bamf*</em> 
</p>
<p>
Okay, now hit the Elite uruk Shaman near the stairs&#8230; <em>*bamf*</em>  Oops, this corner of the level isn't as empty as I thought; I should've taken the time to cast Sense Monsters again.  Wait, there the Ancient red we swapped with the first time, and it's right next to the stairs. 
</p>
<p>
"Way ahead of you, dude." <em>*bamf*</em> 
</p>
<p>
And a mad dash back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gondolin</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"<em>*whew*</em> Hey, hey!  Rock on, dude!  We did it!" 
</p>
<p>
And you were never down more than 305hp out of 940. 
</p>
<p>
"All right!  In your <em>face</em>, black-and-white lady!" 
</p>
<p>
"Aw, I never doubted you for a minute, kid.  I was up here rooting for you the whole time.  We all were, weren't we?" 
</p>
<p>
"Yes, good show, chap. <em>(zizz)</em>  I shall have to remember that strategy for the eventuality that <em>I</em> must stand against the traitorous scoundrel." 
</p>
<p>
"Nicely played, mate.  Quite the commando you are, aren't ye?  I can see I'll &#8216;ave to get me some bigger babies &#8216;fore I try and tangle wit' that lot." 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, I dunno <em>how</em> I'm ever gonna get any of my pure-melee characters through that quest. 
</p>
<p>
"Ooh, <em>very</em> subtle, Human.  I had <em>no idea</em> you were talking about me.  Honest." 
</p>
<p>
Oh?  How do you know I wasn't referring to Graagh? 
</p>
<p>
"Story-man has point.  Graagh not have jump-magic like bear-man use; must fight through all monsters to reach bad Elf.  Will be great challenge." 
</p>
<p>
See?  Even Graagh agrees with me. 
</p>
<p>
"Ooh, you've got an Ogre agreeing with you.  Not exactly an unimpeachable source." 
</p>
<p>
"Black-sword Orc lady insult Graagh?  Orc lady take back, or Graagh smash!" 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, bring it, boulder-brain." 
</p>
<p>
Hey!  Don't make me come down there and separate you two. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  Come on, Bjorn, let's go home. 
</p>
<p>
"Wait, what about all this stuff Mangled dropped?" 
</p>
<p>
Oh yeah, let's see what we got from him&#8230; hmm, some decent saleable armor and weapons, and: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Elfstone 'Elessar' (+7,+7) [+10] (+4), which activates for heal and  cure Black Breath every 200 turns and has radius-3 light, +4 STR, WIS, CHA  and speed, and resist fear, fire, poison and disenchantment 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/alert.png" alt="/!\" height="15" width="15"> Whoa&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15">  I'm gonna have to do some equipment juggling next time out.  I pick up what I stowed in the house here and swing by: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to sell stuff on the way home to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
And after all that excitement, next time we'll be returning to the comparatively boring Land of Mountains. 
</p>
<h4 id="head-666226140709cbc33a5583ccc2b7cf45f5c517e9">Part 7 of 9</h4>
<p>
"Dude, don't forget to&#8230; what was I supposed to remind you of?" 
</p>
<p>
To bring some !oDet's with us, most likely.  Which reminds me, it's been a while since we've been to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Khazad-dum</strong> 
</p>
<p>
The Mining Supply store has only 1 !oDet, and a mildly interesting randart Brass Lantern that I decline to purchase.  Back, then, to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to pick up a few more, and then back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 61</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like any other level."  Any other 3x3 small level, at least. Nothing of note happens, except this dropped by an Ancient multi-hued dragon: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Ring 'Cilierost' (+3), with +3 INT, WIS, DEX, CHA, stealth and  speed and invisibility 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Has some potential&#8230;  Fast forward, then, to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 62</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a good feeling&#8230;"  A few close calls early on, like a Nycadaemon and a budding Greater wall monster infestation in the same room.  My !oDet's see another successful trial when I use one to get rid of a Chaos vortex I don't want to deal with.  Kinda boring from there&#8211; 
</p>
<p>
<em>The Green Thunderlord breathes fire.  Your Spellbook of Charm (f) was destroyed!</em> 
</p>
<p>
"Aw, man, now we gotta go back and get another one, don't we?" 
</p>
<p>
Nah, I haven't been using it that much recently anyway&#8212;and besides, anything that doesn't resist confusion is probably low enough level that I can just absorb the piety hit for now. 
</p>
<p>
"Good call, dude.  Now, halt, you evil spellbook-burning giant bird rider dude!" 
</p>
<p>
Nothing interesting from there, so we continue to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 63</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a very good feeling&#8230;"  First sign of trouble is running into a Lesser balrog, who promptly summons another Lesser balrog, who summons&#8230; another Lesser balrog. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/attention.png" alt="<!>" height="15" width="15"> <img src="./wiki/classic/img/angry.png" alt="X-(" height="15" width="15">  I just barely make it around a corner into ambush position when Essence of Speed gives out. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/alert.png" alt="/!\" height="15" width="15">  The last of the three eats a !oDet as it's approaching, taking it down two stars.  Hmm, I'm not sure how useful these are going to be against the real heavy-hitters&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
And speaking of heavy-hitters, Sense Monsters is detecting a Beholder hive-mother nearby.  <em>[checks notes]</em>  Hmm, I haven't fought one of these before with Bjorn; 4000hp, speed +10, some really annoying attacks and nasty spells, not least the summon-kin spell for which they're infamous. 
</p>
<p>
<em>*shudder*</em> "Brrr&#8230; I <em>hate</em> those things." 
</p>
<p>
"What?  They don't look so tough.  The go-crazy attack looks like the worst part." 
</p>
<p>
"Not for an Alchemist, hon.  Remember, most of my heavy artillery is in wands and staffs, which means I can't let those things anywhere <em>near</em> me.  And by the time I can kill one with ranged attacks, she's usually summoned more.  I remember at one point, when I was fighting Omarax on the Crypt level, I had to just drop all my wands and staffs in an alcove and hope nothing destroyed them while I was fighting." 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, we had to do that for a while with this wall-blaster thing, until dude found out that it was immune to that." 
</p>
<p>
"And don't think I don't envy you that." 
</p>
<p>
Indeed.  Now, if you'll excuse us, Lil, I want to go see just how much trouble these things are gonna be for Bjorn. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, sure.  Good luck, kid." 
</p>
<p>
"&#8216;Kay, thanks, black-and-white lady.  Dude, I still say those things don't look that tough." 
</p>
<p>
Well, we're about to find out.  I approach the Beholder hive-mother and get into position, clearing out a pack of Vrocks on the way.  I toss another !oDet at her as she comes around the ambush corner, taking her down two stars.  Hmm, maybe these will be more useful than I thought&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
The hive-mother goes down in three turns, but she spends one of those three summoning two more. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/angry.png" alt="X-(" height="15" width="15">  I Phase Door into another nearby room to set up my ambush corner again.  This time I drop a Noxious Cloud on the first one as she comes into line of sight; not as much damage, but at least it might start softening up the second one behind her&#8230;  This one also falls in three turns, but summons another behind me. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, this is getting annoying&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
I'll say.  I Phase Door out again into another room and smack down a pack of Black puddings while the hive-mothers are creeping down the corridor toward me.  Here we go again&#8230;  I hit the leader with another !oDet as she comes around the corner; this time, it only does one star of damage.  Not good.  At least this time the accursed thing's summons doesn't include any more hive-mothers.  Thank Manwe for small favors. 
</p>
<p>
<em>[sound F/X:  crickets chirping]</em> "What, was I actually s'posed to do it that time?" 
</p>
<p>
No, just making sure you didn't.  The first one falls just in time for the second one to come into view.  My last !oDet for this run does two stars of damage to her.  And just as I'm about to kill her&#8230; she summons two more. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/angry.png" alt="X-(" height="15" width="15"> <img src="./wiki/classic/img/angry.png" alt="X-(" height="15" width="15">  Okay, that's it, all of you just go away! <em>[sound F/X: Teleport Away spell]</em>  Oh, terrific, one of the hive-mothers resists, and summons yet <em>another</em> hive-mother.  That's it, I'm teleporting out of here. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa.  I see now why black-and-white lady doesn't like those things." 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, I think I'll have to put that one back at the top of my List of Monsters to Avoid At All Costs&#8482;.  Hmm&#8230; actually, I wonder if the Banishment spell might help here. 
</p>
<p>
"But that would just teleport them away, right?  We can already do that with the go-away spell." 
</p>
<p>
Ah, but Beholder hive-mothers resist teleportation, as we've just seen; since they're level 67, there's a two-thirds chance they won't be teleported away and will get hit by the suspend effect.  Now, they might resist that part too, but that's less likely&#8230; <em>[checks notes]</em> less than fifty percent chance, if I'm reading this right.  If my Tome of the Time were fireproof, I'd start carrying it with me to try that strategy. 
</p>
<p>
For the nonce, though, I spend the rest of the level dodging the Beholder hive-mothers, and then move on to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 64</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  Bleh.  My sanity is down to 529/569 after all that mess; I think I can leave it there for now. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, dude, this is <em>way</em> better than the mushrooms!" 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15"> And here comes another candidate for the LoMtAAAC&#8482;:  an Archlich. <em>[checks notes]</em> Another one Bjorn hasn't fought; 4500hp, +10 speed, some annoying attacks, and a whole raft of bad spells. 
</p>
<p>
"Aw, man, is this guy gonna pull the same summoning trick as the eye mother thing?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, it does have a summon greater undead spell, but there are more types of undead monsters, so it's less likely to specifically summon another Archlich.  Of course, there's always the chance it could summon a Nazgul&#8230; Well, let's get in there and see how bad it's gonna be. 
</p>
<p>
"Right.  Halt, you evil arch licker!" 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> The Archlich falls in five turns.  It does manage a summons, but fortunately we're in a blind alley, and it only gets a Monastic lich and a Grave wight.  Its drop includes no fewer than four Tomes&#8212;none of the Time, unfortunately. 
</p>
<p>
Most of the rest of the level is fairly straightforward.  There are two notable highlights:  first, near the northern edge of the level is another of those unidentifiable vault-esque room-like things, this one looking like a small network of caverns:

</pre>Two of the p's in the westernmost cavern are Saruman and Harowen, and the R near the middle is the Tarrasque. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/alert.png" alt="/!\" height="15" width="15">  Needless to say, I didn't take on this one. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
The other interesting bit is on the west edge of the level:  a lesser vault (maze of rooms), whose toughest occupants appear to be some Chaos hounds&#8230; oh, and a couple Great Wyrms.  Hmm, think you can take them, Bjorn? 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, lemme at &#8216;em!" 
</p>
<p>
What worries me is, that might be the sanity hit talking&#8230;  Well, at least in case of extreme emergency, Great Wyrms don't appear to resist teleportation&#8212;except for Great Wyrms of Power, which, mercifully, we aren't likely to be encountering any time soon. 
</p>
<p>
I punch into the vault on the south side, pushing east through some orcs and Cave ogres, angling for the Great Bile Wyrm near the middle.  A few of the Chaos hounds leak out as I approach, so I have to dive for a corner to ambush them.  Oh, crap, there's a Lesser black reaver on the western side of the vault, and he's awake and punching through the walls.  This could make things messy. 
</p>
<p>
By this time the Great Ice Wyrm has woken up and is next to the Great Bile Wyrm&#8212;and that Lesser black reaver is getting too close for comfort. Hmm, from here I can punch south through the wall to the outer corridor ring of the vault and maybe lure the reaver west.  By the time I get the @#$%ing wand to work, though, he's right next to the Great wyrms, and I have to do some fancy footwork to get him lured into the outer ring with me and still leave the Great Wyrms on the inside. 
</p>
<p>
The reaver falls in three turns, and the Ancient black dragon that came out behind him falls in two.  And there's an Ancient multi-hued not far behind him.  Man, and I thought this was gonna be an easy vault&#8230;  The AMHD goes down in another two turns; some Rotting corpses and Chaos hounds are the next out of the gate, followed by an Emperor Wight and an Ancient white.  And that seems to be the worst of the monsters in the immediate vicinity; time to lure out one of the Great Wyrms. 
</p>
<p>
"Here he comes.  Halt, you very cold evil lizard thing!" 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15"> The Ice Wyrm is indeed the first around the corner.  I crank Tactic up to berzerker and lay into it, taking it down three stars on the first turn.  It falls in another two turns, wasting one of them attempting to cast a confusion spell at me. 
</p>
<p>
"See?  Told'ja we could take &#8216;em." 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, well, we've got the Bile Wyrm to lure out next, and he's tougher.  A Forest wight and a Mature white come out ahead of it, but it's not far behind.  This time I only take it down two stars on the first turn, which bodeth not well.  It takes five turns to fall, and gets in a few hits, but luckily doesn't breathe. 
</p>
<p>
"Man, you had me worried there, dude.  They weren't so tough." 
</p>
<p>
Mmh.  The rest of the vault is fairly easy; apart from the last few Chaos hounds, the worst monster left is a Skull druj, conveniently positioned so that I can poke through the wall and get the drop on him&#8212;although he does get a water ball spell in on me.  Maybe I should've just hung back and whittled him down with Manathrusts&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
Some of the Wyrms' loot did get destroyed by breaths from Chaos hounds (and that one Chaos vortex), and there's not much left that's particularly interesting&#8230; well, unless you count this Ring of Speed [+9]. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> <img src="./wiki/classic/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15">  I have <em>gotta</em> do some equipment juggling here&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
And on that high note, we return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Loth</strong><tt>^H^H^H^H</tt><strong>Wilderness</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Oh yeah, I keep forgetting about that.  Anyway, the returning continues until we get back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
where I break out my !oCLIns stash and get Bjorn straightened out. 
</p>
<p>
"Thanks, dude, that was gettin' kinda weird there.  Whoa, wait, did I actually fight those great big huge dragon things head on?  Man, I must've been crazy." 
</p>
<p>
Heh.  We take a quick side trip to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to sell off loot; the Library there also has a Spellbook of Charm to replace the one I lost to that Thunderlord.  Back in: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
we pick up a few more !oDet's and prepare to return to the dungeon next time out.  Oh, and I think an <a class="external" href="./www.killerbunnies.org/angband/ladder/bear/bear_3.html"><img src="./wiki/classic/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">updated dump</a> ls long overdue. 
</p>
<h4 id="head-ad90f57b65a4b92a45293c0d79e2c3c492677b84">Part 8 of 9</h4>
<p>
"Uh&#8230; was I s'posed to remind of you of something?" 
</p>
<p>
I don't think so.  I do notice that our !oDet stockpile is getting low, though, so we'll start with a run to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Khazad-dum</strong> 
</p>
<p>
where the Mining Supply store has 3!oDet's; that brings me up to 8 in pack and 8 at home.  I only want to carry a few at once, so I return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to stow the three I just bought, and then return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 64</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like any other level."  Nothing of interest in Sense Monster range, except for a Death drake I'll have to keep an eye out for. 
</p>
<p>
A bit further in, though, I detect Bjorn's first Bone golem, in what looks to be a four-subroom pit.  <em>[checks notes]</em> Hmm, 3500hp, +10 speed, attacks for disenchant and drain STR, and some nasty spells, notably a summon greater undead spell.  And just to make things annoying, it's in a room with an Ancient bronze dragon and a Lesser balrog.  We'll have to approach this carefully. 
</p>
<p>
"You worry too much, dude.  Lemme at &#8216;em!" 
</p>
<p>
Uh-huh.  As I arrive in the room, I can see a couple holes poked through some of the inner walls, allowing the monsters in the Bone golem's subroom to leak out through another of the subrooms.  An Ancient gold from the other room comes out first, followed by the Bone golem, who gets a !oDet in the skeletal face as it comes around the corner&#8212;and oddly enough, starts bleeding as a result of the shards explosion. 
</p>
<p>
"Eww!  Dude, that's just not right&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Hey, don't knock it, it means the accursed thing will die faster. 
</p>
<p>
"Right.  Halt, you bleeding bony evildoer!" 
</p>
<p>
Actually, the fight goes rather well; the Bone golem falls in three turns, after I remember to restart Manwe's Blessing; it gets in a cause-cuts spell, but luckily doesn't summon.  The rest of the room falls without incident. 
</p>
<p>
For that matter, so does the rest of the level.  Shadowfax is here; I teleport him away a couple times.  The most notable event is finding another Tome of the Time, which might give me a chance to try out my Banishment strategy.  It's not fireproof, but it's just a spare, so losing it wouldn't be disastrous.  Anyway, let's try for more excitement on: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 65</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  Actually, there's a Hand druj rather close by that I don't feel the least bit superb about&#8230;  I'm 38exp from the next level as I enter the level; the first monster I run into, however, is an Elder vampire, who manages to knock that back about 20,000 or so. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/angry.png" alt="X-(" height="15" width="15">  That's what I'm carrying the restoration junkart around for, though&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  Restoring takes me up to <em>clvl 48</em>, with all five skill points going to Prayer.  Which reminds me, I haven't tried Manwe's Call again since the first time, when it ran into a stray Noxious Cloud; let's see how it does against these Phantom warriors. 
</p>
<p>
"&#8216;Kay.  <em>By the power of god dude Manwe, I summon a mighty eagle!</em>" 
</p>
<p>
Impressive, it tears right through the Phantom warriors&#8230; and a Nether wraith&#8230; <em>and</em> draws fire from that Hand druj I'd forgotten about while I pelt it with Manathrusts.  Not bad.  <em>[checks notes]</em> Let's see, Manwe's Call is at spell effect level 25, which means the Great eagle is leveled to level 55&#8230; which means it averages 440hp, +31 speed, AC 105, and 60.5 damage per round of attacks&#8212;and at +31 speed, it tends to get more than a few rounds in. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15">  I don't get any experience for its kills, of course, so I won't be keeping it around. 
</p>
<p>
"Fly free now, eagle guy.  And, like, thanks again.  Dude, that was cool." 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, we might summon up a couple of those in the future for tough fights. And that was just the very first room of the level; let's see what else is here&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
I should've known better than to ask that.  What's here is Azriel.  Crap, he's good and high level, so killing him would be a major piety hit, he resists teleportation, so I can't just get rid of him, he's a unique, so I can't charm him, and he's got a nasty nether breath that I <em>really</em> don't want to be on the wrong end of.  Nothing for it but to teleport away, then&#8230;  I land in another room near the northeast corner (I entered at the northwest corner, for reference), wherein a Young gold dragon drops the first crossbow of Siegecraft I've ever seen with any character. 
</p>
<p>
"Check it out, dude, it's got foldable legs that, like, lock into the floor and stuff.  And look, fold-out barriers to block shots.  But wait, what if you gotta move while you've got it set up?" 
</p>
<p>
You can't.  That's the trade-off. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh.  We gonna be using it?" 
</p>
<p>
No, you don't have any Archery skill; but it should sell for a bit.  Hmm, and speaking of saleable stuff, there's a randart amulet lying in the next room: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Amulet of Lomenwe (+4), with +4 STR, sustain INT, resist cold,  poison, blindness and nether, levitation, see invisible and slow digestion 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Actually, that might be decent swap-in kit for the equipment rearrangement I keep putting off; I'll stow it when I get back topside. 
</p>
<p>
The level is relatively uneventful for a while, apart from dodging Azriel and a Seraph he summoned.  I run into another Archlich, who falls in five turns&#8212;but not before summoning a pack of Barbazu behind me. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/angry.png" alt="X-(" height="15" width="15"> I <em>really</em> need to look into better summoner strategies&#8230;  By the time I finish cleaning them out, a Great White Wyrm has wandered in on the other side of the room.  Fortunately this is a pit-style room, so I can ambush it at a corner along the outer ring.  The Wyrm falls in four turns, but it does get a frost breath in, shattering one of my !oCCW's. 
</p>
<p>
"Uh, hey, dude, what happens if one of these exploding potion things gets shattered like that?" 
</p>
<p>
Nothing good, I imagine.  We've got resist shards, so that should minimize the damage; though I suppose we should really look into getting cold immunity from somewhere&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"O-<em>kaaay</em>&#8230;" <em>(holds !oDet's out away from self)</em> 
</p>
<p>
From there, we proceed to the southwest corner, where a troll pit nets: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Scythe 'Avavir' (+8,+8) [+10] (+3), which activates for word of  recall every 200 turns and has +3 DEX and CHA, fire and frost brand, free  action, resist fire, cold and light, and see invisible 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
The capper of the level is back near the northern edge of the level:  a lesser vault (lesser crypt), which nets nothing of interest.  Hmm, my pack's getting kinda full; I think it's time to recall back out to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wilderness</strong> 
</p>
<p>
and do a town tour.  In: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
I stow Lomenwe and a Potion of *Healing* I picked up somewhere; to make room for this, I pick up an old Drum of Power I had squirreled away, with an eye to stashing it elsewhere.  On a lark, I upgrade my Elven Cloak with an Elven Cloak of Stealth [+15] (+4) from the Black Market; the Stealth ego seems to be redundant, as both cloaks are +4 to stealth, but the new one has a few points more AC.  From there we proceed to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to sell off some stuff, and to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gondolin</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to stow Avavir and the Drum of Power.  And the Gondolin Black Market <em>finally</em> has the Wand of Stone Prison I've been looking for&#8212;three of them, to be precise.  I buy them all and stow two in my Gondolin home for emergencies.  For completeness I sweep by: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Minas Anor</strong> 
</p>
<p>
on the way home; they don't have anything interesting, so I return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
where the Black Market now has a Potion of Experience.  I still have more than 600,000 exp to go for the next level after quaffing it, but hey, every little bit helps, right?  I also buy a Potion of Resistance; it occurs to me that since I don't have any other source of temporary resistances, I should probably start collecting these for emergencies. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, this is turning into an awful lot of stuff to carry around." 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, I think I'll sell off the Spellbook of Charm to make a bit of room; after all, I can always conjure up an eagle to take care of any good monsters for me. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, check it out, the book seller guy has some of these be-nice-spell books that are fireproof.  What a coincidence, huh?" 
</p>
<p>
<em>(slaps forehead)</em> Ya know, I've been looking for one of those to show up in one of the stores ever since I used up the fireproofing from the Mage quest, and <em>now</em> they show up, when I don't need them anymore. Somewhere, the RNG is laughing at my expense again&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  Wait, that reminds me, I think we picked up a fate on the way back from Minas Anor; let's go check&#8230; ooh, I'm fated to meet a Pitiful-looking beggar on dlvl 20.  Be still, my heart. 
</p>
<p>
"Man, that Orangey guy must <em>really</em> have it for us." 
</p>
<p>
Um&#8230; yeah.  <em>[rereads write-up so far]</em> Man, we only got one level deeper this time out; we're gonna have to pick up the pace if we don't want this story to stretch on forever.  But we'll worry about that next time out&#8230; 
</p>
<h4 id="head-9b20f6ab78cefda53daf6fca36a0b8da6b2a99c9">Part 9 of 9</h4>
<p>
First, as is becoming something of a habit, a quick side trip to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Khazad-dum</strong> 
</p>
<p>
finding on the way my first Scroll of Fire&#8212;and of <em>course</em>, it was Fireproof&#8230;  Anyway, the Mining Supply store has only one !oDet.  On the way back through: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>MoM 50</strong> 
</p>
<p>
a pack of Half-ogres drops: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Short Bow of Amrod (x4) (+12,+15) (+2), with +2 STR and CON and  might, resist lighning, fire and cold, and regeneration 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
which I stow in Gondolin before returning to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 65</strong>, take 2 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like any other level."  And just to welcome me back, there's an Ancient green dragon practically on top of me as I enter the level. 
</p>
<p>
Other than that, the level's fairly boring.  It's a destroyed level, so Thrain's wand gets a workout.  Near the end, I pick up a Rod Tip of Restoration, hoping to find a good high-mana Rod of Simplicity and make something that's easier to activate than this junkart.  Anyway, though, we proceed from here to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 66</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a very good feeling&#8230;"  Early on, I get one of my theories tested: 
</p>
<p>
<em>The Aether vortex breathes sound.  You have been stunned.  One of your Potions of Detonations (i) was destroyed!</em> 
</p>
<p>
and I take no damage. <em>*whew*</em>  Dunno whether it did normal blast damage, as said Aether vortex was out of range. 
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, the level's rather boring; fast-forward to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 67</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You like the look of this place&#8230;"  Yeah, nice place, but kinda boring. Only two points of interest:  Bjorn's first Great Wyrm of Perplexity, and a Demonic Q that summoned Vrocks and a Bile Demon before I can smackenate it. Other than that, we can just move on to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 68</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  Another destroyed level; and Thrain's wand was still smarting from the last one.  I'll proabably have to go back topside after this level, between that and being brain-smashed by a Mind flayer. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa!  The colors, dude!" 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15">  Near the northwest corner, I run into a pack of Barbazu, with a Gelugon and a Bile Demon mixed in just for the variety; between them, they drop: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Scythe of Valdil (+14,+10) (+1), with +1 DEX and attacks, lightning  brand, drain life, vorpal effects, and slay orc and Xdemon 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Light Crossbow 'Cirhuanna' (x6) (+10,+12) (+3), with radius-1 light  and +3 STR, DEX, CON, CHA, speed and might 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Say, Cirhuanna would give me everything Gured is currently giving me (except for extra shots, which is irrelevant to Bjorn), but one point higher&#8212;and it would give me <em>speed</em>.  Hello, swap-in. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15">  This brings my top speed up to +30. 
</p>
<p>
"Righteous, dude!  I am a total speed demon now!" 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, I think that qualifies as pretty superb. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  This means I'll have to be more attentive, though, because the "Fast (+&#8230;)" flag won't go away anymore or turn into "Slow (-&#8230;)" when Essence of Speed wears off; it'll just become smaller.  Hmm, I wonder if there's an easy way to hack the code to have it display the "You feel yourself slow down" message in some more noticeable color&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
Anyway, not much further in, I find out first-hand what a full-strength Great Ice Wyrm breath feels like, when I accidentally walk into line of sight of one and it takes me down to about 680/1095hp in one stroke.  See, <em>this</em> is why I was worried the first time, Bjorn. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh.  <em>*brrr*</em> Gotcha, dude." 
</p>
<p>
Said Wyrm does not survive the effrontery, of course, but doubtless you already expected that&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  And that's it; Thrain's wand is out of charges, and I've gone everywhere on the level I can go without a shovel. Hmm, before I head back, there's a Potion of Curing on the floor nearby; I wonder if it cures sanity hits.  <em>*gulp gulp*</em> Ah, it does.  Good, that's one less step after I return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wilderness</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Let's see, first we swing by: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to sell off loot&#8212;including Gured, since I can't think of a reason I'd ever want to swap that back in instead of Cirhuanna.  In: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
I charge Thrain's wand back up, this time to 150 charges just to be safe. I'd like to stow the Rod Tip of Restoration for now, but there's no room in my house; so I pick up the Star of Elendil and shuttle it over to my house in: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gondolin</strong> 
</p>
<p>
And as long as I'm in the neighborhood, I think I'll swing by: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Khazad-dum</strong> 
</p>
<p>
and pick up another !oDet.  From there we return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 68</strong>, take 2 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like any other level."  <em>Another</em> destroyed level.  Aside from Bjorn's first Great Wyrm of Thunder, nothing of interest happens, so we move on to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 69</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  About halfway in, I meet Bjorn's first Great Swamp Wyrm, who drops a Ring of Speed (+5) and: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Lochaber Axe 'Dragonbane' (+20,+20) (+2 attacks), with +2 attacks,  slay Xdragon, and resist acid, lightning, fire, cold and poison 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Paging Alanis Morrisette&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  Further in, a Dracolisk drops: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Amulet of Ingwe (+3), which activates for dispel evil (lev*5) every  300+d300 turns and has +3 INT, WIS, CHA, searching and infravision, free  action, resist acid, lightning, and cold, and see invisible 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Man, at this rate my Gondolin home's gonna be full too before long&#8230;  The level finishes off with a lesser vault (Cross) with another Great Swamp Wyrm, who drops a Ring of Speed (+7).  Also in the vault I find junkart Balrilbon's Soulgem, which activates for acquirement.  Hmm, let's see what it can cough up&#8230; and the first try produces an Amulet of Resistance. Ooh, I'm underwhelmed. 
</p>
<p>
"What, was it, like, supposed to make something really cool? 
</p>
<p>
The scrolls are, but the junkarts tend not to.  I don't think I'm even gonna bother keeping it.  My pack is getting kinda full, though, so I think it's time to head back: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wilderness</strong> 
</p>
<p>
First, as usual, to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to sell off loot.  It feels weird selling off Rings of Speed, but neither of them beat the Ring of Speed (+9) I've already got, and I can't wear two of them without losing the Ring of Extra Attacks.  Anyway, next stop is: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gondolin</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to stow Ingwe and Dragonbane.  For completeness, we swing by: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Minas Anor</strong> 
</p>
<p>
where the Black Market has a Mithril Rod of Cheapness of Nothing.  Rr, the mana is high enough, but I wanted Simplicity, not Cheapness.  I do buy the Potion of *Healing* they have, and stow that in: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
with a few other things I collected in the dungeon.  Now back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 69</strong>, take 2 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like any other level."  Notable on this level is my first Jabberwock near the entrance, which takes me to <em>clvl 49</em>; as before, all skill points go to Prayer.  A bit further in, a pack of Ice trolls pushes me up over 100,000 piety for the first time.  Hmm, too bad Manwe doesn't offer resurrection at this piety level, like Eru does. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa.  Dude, is it too late to switch to this Eru god dude?" 
</p>
<p>
I think we're fine where we are, Bjorn. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  For our next surprise, a Spectral Mage drops a chest that disgorges: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Seeker Arrow of Gondor (10d8) (+10,+20), with slay demon and evil 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Not quite as impressive as I was expecting, but still, I wouldn't turn my nose up at it with an Archer. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, who keeps cool arrows like this in a chest?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, he <em>was</em> a Mage, after all; and the monsters don't have homes to stow all this stuff like we do. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, yeah, good point." 
</p>
<p>
And that's about it for this level; we move on to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 70</strong> 
</p>
<p>
You have a superb feeling about this level."  The high point of the first part of the level is a giant pit with three Hrus in it.  I don't even bother shepherding them anywhere, I just fight them where they stand and let them blow chunks out of the level; between them, they only knocked me down to 960/1150hp anyway.  Other than that&#8211; 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, that giant bird rider guy over there looks pretty pissed." 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, Trone's like that&#8230; oh yeah, that's right, it's <em>Erebor</em> that goes all the way down to level 72; this level <em>is</em> the bottom of the Land of Mountains, isn't it? <img src="./wiki/classic/img/redface.png" alt=":o" height="15" width="15">  Okay, the first thing we need to is step back out of Trone's line of sight.  <em>[checks notes]</em> Ouch, 8000hp, speed +20, 120AC, <em>brutal</em> melee damage, breathes fire <em>and</em> time, and has a mana bolt spell and a summon Thunderlords spell. Not good. 
</p>
<p>
"Ah, c'mon, we can take him, dude." 
</p>
<p>
Well, I certainly mean to try.  Okay, first we should choke off his summoning abilities with a Stone Prison.  Next we bring Manwe's Blessing and Wind Shield back up.  We're next to the wall of the room, and Trone's in a corridor on the other side of the wall; there's a door in the wall diagonally between him and us, so all we have to do now is wait.  When he opens the door, I drop a Noxious Cloud in his path, just for the extra bit of continuous damage; then he steps up to the plate and battle is joined. 
</p>
<p>
First round, Trone's down one star and I'm down to 1072/1150hp.  Hmm, I missed an annoying number of those attacks; I could crank Tactic up to berzerker, but that does a number on my AC, and I'd rather he not hit me very often.  Let's hold here for now.  Second round, Trone's down three stars, and he misses the turn.  Say, we might just be able to pull this off at this rate. 
</p>
<p>
"Told'ja, dude.  Now, let's rock his beak!" 
</p>
<p>
Third round, Trone is down to five stars, and he wastes the turn casting a fear spell. 
</p>
<p>
"Nyah, I'm not afraid of you, ya loser!" :P 
</p>
<p>
Let's not get carried away here, Bjorn.  Fourth round, Trone is down to three stars and finally breathes fire, taking me to 831/1150hp.  Hmm, I've got a Potion of *Healing* on hand, but I think I can take another breath at this rate, so I'll hold onto it for now.  Fifth round, Trone is down to one star&#8212;and runs! 
</p>
<p>
"We got him now, dude!  Hey, come back here, ya wimp!" 
</p>
<p>
Trone's fire breath left a shallow lava square in my path as I head out of the stone prison after him; I brave it, and it does minimal damage.  And this must be another turn that Trone misses, because he doesn't move, and one last round of smackenation finishes him off. 
</p>
<p>
"Ha!  Busted, loser!" 
</p>
<p>
Don't celebrate yet, Bjorn; Trone apparently managed to summon a Brown Thunderlord while we were ducking out of his line of sight earlier, and now it's come for revenge. 
</p>
<p>
"So?  We just, like, offed his boss, how tough can he be?" 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, but it just knocked us down to 791/1150hp. 
</p>
<p>
"Ah, that's nothin'.  Watch <em>this</em>." 
</p>
<p>
And sure enough, the Brown Thunderlord is dead in two turns. 
</p>
<p>
"See?  You don't mess with the mighty Bjorn." 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15"> You're starting to sound like Zizzo, you know that? 
</p>
<p>
"I heard that. <em>(zizz)</em>" 
</p>
<p>
Okay, okay, let's just go over Trone's drop:  some saleable loot, plus: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Battle Axe 'Lotharang' (+4,+3) (+1), which activates for cure  serious wounds every 3+d3 turns and has +1 STR and DEX and slay orc and  troll 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Iron Crown of Beruthiel [+20] (-5), with -5 STR, DEX and CON, free  action, levitation, see invisible, telepathy, cursed and auto-curse 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
and the one we've all been waiting for: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Thunderlord Coat of Trone [+20] (+4), with +4 INT, CON, stealth and  speed, immunity to fire, resist acid, lightning, cold and nexus, flight,  sense thunderlords, reflection and fire aura 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
And Sense Monsters is detecting Tselakus nearby, who I'm in no condition to fight; we thus recall posthaste to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wilderness</strong> 
</p>
<p>
and follow the standard town loop:  to 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to sell off loot, then to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gondolin</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to stow stuff, then back home to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
with my brand new Thunderlord Coat of Trone.  Hmm, the Black Market has a Scroll of Acquirement; I think I'll take it back down to LoM 70 next time out to see what it can cough up.  And now I've <em>gotta</em> make some equipment decisions&#8230; 
</p>
<h3 id="head-d088120e92eeda9a2dfbd8a7392af15a9523bde2">INTERMISSION:  Don't Drink and Dive</h3>
<p>
Grr&#8230; I <em>still</em> can't find an equipment combination that covers everything I want&#8230;  Well, maybe I'll get lucky with this Scroll of Acquirement on: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LoM 70</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"What're we doing back down here, dude?" 
</p>
<p>
I don't remember whether dungeon depth affects what Acquirement scrolls generate, but I figure it can't hurt. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh.  &#8216;Kay." 
</p>
<p>
Now, can I have the envelope, please? <em>[drum roll]</em>  And the scroll creates&#8230;  Partial Plate Armor of Resist Lightning [+13].  Well, <em>that</em> was a bust.  No point in even bringing that back with me. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Hmm, well, there's one more trick I can try, but it's a long shot; we'll go to Gondolin and take the: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Eol the Dark Elf quest</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"So who's this Eeyore dude?" 
</p>
<p>
Ëol.  He's trying to find his way into Gondolin looking for his wife Aredhel and his son Maeglin. 
</p>
<p>
"Wait, didn't we already fight Mangled?" 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, we kinda did these quests out of chronological order.  This quest should be easier than the Maeglin quest, though; Ëol only has 2400hp, and doesn't do near as much damage in a fight.  Plus there's only him to fight, unless he summons something. 
</p>
<p>
"Too easy, dude.  Let's rock his world." 
</p>
<p>
That's the spirit.  Okay, first thing we need to do as we enter the quest level is cast Sense Hidden to find all the traps he's laid.  Okay, he's over on the far side of the level; let's light things up with Vision&#8230; hmm, some caves.  Good, that'll give us cover.  Let him come to us. 
</p>
<p>
And that was anticlimactic; Ëol falls in three turns, without even getting in an attack.  Shoulda' taken that one earlier, too.  He doesn't drop anything useful, except a Westernesse weapon which will sell for a bit. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gondolin</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"So&#8230; why'd we do this quest again?" 
</p>
<p>
I'm gambling on the quest reward, a Dwarven Lantern of the Magi.  I'm hoping it'll have some useful flag that'll make my equipment juggling work. <em>[sound F/X:  casts Greater Identify]</em>  Hmm, it has invisibility and resist blindness; I don't think that really helps. 
</p>
<p>
"Bummer.  Any other quests we can do?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, there is Nirnaeth Arnoediad. 
</p>
<p>
"Uh&#8230; gesundheit?" 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  I think I could complete it the cheesy way with the Recall spell, but that doesn't feel right; I'd rather take those trolls with me.  Anyway, we'll deal with that later; I've got something else I want to work on for a while.  Back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
where we buy out the Inn's supply of of Fine Ale and Fine Wine. 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/alert.png" alt="/!\" height="15" width="15"> <img src="./wiki/classic/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15"> "Uh&#8230; dude?  Don't get me wrong, I'm all in favor of, like, getting righteously plastered and stuff, but do we <em>really</em> need to buy in bulk?  People are gonna talk." 
</p>
<p>
Oh, you can't get drunk on this stuff.  Go ahead, try it. 
</p>
<p>
"&#8216;Kay&#8230;" <em>*gulp gulp*</em> "Bleh.  Bogus, dude.  They call this wine? It's barely fruit juice." 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, the only point of buying it is that it's the only way to get empty bottles in bulk. 
</p>
<p>
"Huh?  Hey, you're right, the bottles aren't disappearing like they do with potions.  Why's that?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, it <em>is</em> the cheap stuff; they probably use the non-thaumodegradable packaging just to save on costs. 
</p>
<p>
"Totally not environmentally friendly, dude.  But what do we need the bottles for?" 
</p>
<p>
We're going to fill them. 
</p>
<p>
"How?  Where?" 
</p>
<p>
You know those fountains we've seen from time to time in the dungeon? 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, you said don't drink from them, even when I was, like, <em>really</em> thirsty." 
</p>
<p>
Yes, those fountains are of potion liquids.  If you quaff them without identifying the liquid first, you might find yourself drinking a Potion of Detonations, or Death. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa.  So, how do you identify the liquid?" 
</p>
<p>
You fill a bottle with it and identify the potion. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, I get it.  There's some potion things you want a lot of, so you're gonna go find a fountain of &#8216;em and fill up a lot of bottles." 
</p>
<p>
Specifically, Healing and *Healing*, and maybe some Detonations. 
</p>
<p>
"Cool.  So, where are we goin' to look for fountains?" 
</p>
<p>
I'm thinking Erebor&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Ere 60</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa!  Dude, this place is <em>huge</em>!" 
</p>
<p>
Well, yeah, it's built on dragon scale.  That's why I chose this dungeon; even the fountains are king-sized.  Unfortunately, there's only one on this level, and it's surrounded by lava.  Hmm, I don't think I'm carrying much that's flammable&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"Ow ow ow!" 
</p>
<p>
Sorry.  Okay, this fountain is&#8230; Cure Serious Insanity.  Enh, not what I had in mind.  Let's head back upstairs and try this again&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
I won't bore you with the details of bouncing up and down between Ere 60 and Ere 61; suffice it to say that fountains were rare, and the only useful potions I found were just lying on the floor instead.  I did find: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Red Dragon Scale Mail 'Darast' [+15], which activates for breath  fire (200) every 90+d90 turns and has immunity to fire, hold life, and  resist lighning, fire, light and chaos 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
which might be useful. 
</p>
<p>
"So that was kind of a bust, huh?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, it wasn't terribly productive.  I could try in the Sandworm Lair, I suppose; it looks I could find Potions of Healing there, but not *Healing*. I think I'll give Erebor another try first. 
</p>
<p>
"Whatever you say, dude&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
This second trip was much more productive; I walked out with 84 Potions of *Healing*, five more Potions of Resistance, and: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Golden Crown of Amend [0,+11], with hold life, resist lightning and  poison, and see invisible 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Light War Axe 'Limbslicer' (+12,+15) (+4), with +4 DEX, vorpal  effects and wounding 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Ring 'Imaguinon' (+3), with +3 STR and attacks, sustain INT, and  resist dark and confusion 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>

<img src="./wiki/classic/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> <img src="./wiki/classic/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> I think that last one plugs one of the holes I was having problems with before.  Lemme go back to my equipment optimizer&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
And I think we have a winner, ladies and gentlemen.  First, a quick town tour: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Minas Anor</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to pull some kit out of mothballs, 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to sell off some loot (and to buy another Potion of *Healing* from the Black Market), 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gondolin</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to stow Amend and Limbslicer, and back home to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to make the final swaps:  Trone for Arvedui, Elessar for the Amulet of the Magi, and the Long Bow of Bard for the Crossbow 'Cirhuanna'.  I gain +4 WIS and stealth, +1 CON and light radius, +2 luck, +5 speed, <img src="./wiki/classic/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> fire immunity, reflection, resist fear and disenchantment, fire aura, and sense dragon and thunderlord; I lose -1 STR, DEX and CHA, -4 searching, resist shards and slow digestion.  I can regain those last two by swapping in the Ring of Belduin for the Ring of Damage, which I'm loath to do for now&#8212;though that instant +11 to-hit and to-dam just from swapping out that Amulet of the Magi for Elessar is nice.  With the loss of resist shards, though, I'm going to stow the Potions of Detonations for a while, and start packing some of those Potions of *Healing* instead. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, I'm likin' this new suit, dude.  So, we goin' back to Dragonsville to look for more fountains?" 
</p>
<p>
Nope; now that we've got fire immunity in the bag, we're headed for Mordor&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
[Oh, and now that I've finally got my equipment sorted out, I think it's time for an <a class="external" href="./www.killerbunnies.org/angband/ladder/bear/bear_3.html"><img src="./wiki/classic/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">updated dump</a>].

<h4 id="head-57607941f159524e5709b17bbc7f69062d0d548a">Part 1 of 8</h4>
<p>
As promised, this time we'll be taking on Mordor. 
</p>
<p>
"So what's Mortar like?" 
</p>
<p>
Kind of like Moria, except with lava instead of water&#8212;which is why fire immunity is important.  And the early levels are going to be significantly easier than the low levels of the Sacred Land of Mountains. 
</p>
<p>
"Excellent, I could use some slack-off time.  Let's do it." 
</p>
<p>
Hmm, it feels like I'm forgetting to mention something&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 34</strong>: Princess quest for Draebor the Imp 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/alert.png" alt="/!\" height="15" width="15"> "Dude, you have <em>got</em> to be kidding me." 
</p>
<p>
Ah, yes, that was it:  Mordor is one of the main-line dungeons, so we'll be getting random quests again. 
</p>
<p>
"What, so the badguys just, like, took a break from kidnapping princesses while we were in the Righteous Mountains, and now they've started up again, just in time for use to arrive here in Mortar?" 
</p>
<p>
<em>(shrug)</em> Well, we don't know how long she's actually been held here. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa, good point.  We better go find her, then." 
</p>
<p>
As predicted, the level is little challenge.  The most interesting bit is finally taking on a jelly pit with Bjorn, an assault made much easier with a high-powered Noxious Cloud. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, that was disgusting.  I've got slimy stuff all in my fur now." 
</p>
<p>
I'm sure it'll wash out.  I finally find the quest room in the northeast corner of the level. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, brave hero, save me!" 
</p>
<p>
"That's what I'm here for, Princess Lady." <em>*slash slash*</em> <em>*thud*</em>  "Hope I didn't keep you waiting too long." 
</p>
<p>
"That matters not, brave warrior, now that you have rescued me." 
</p>
<p>
"So, like, just for reference, are you Zoot, Clarice, or Officer Jenny?" 
</p>
<p>
"I am Princess Vespa of Castle Druidia.  But Zoot and Clarice have told me of your great bravery in rescuing them." 
</p>
<p>
"Well, I don't wanna brag or nothin'&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Oh dear gods, he's <em>really</em> starting to sound like Zizzo now&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"Hmph.  True adventurers are never respected in their time. <em>(zizz)</em>" 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15"> Draebor falls in two turns, and drops a Small Wooden Boomerang (+7,+2) and a Dagger (+4,+6).  The reward choices are a Ball-and-Chain, a Dagger or a Beaked Axe.  Not much to distinguish them; I take the axe. Just on principle, I walk across the lava moat to get to the reward, rather than going around the back way.  Fire immunity is fun&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  The quest reward turns out to be: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Beaked Axe of Theoden (+8,+10) (+3), which activates for drain life  (120) every 400 turns and has +3 WIS and CON, slay dragon, sense undead and  evil, and slow digestion 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Heh, at this rate my Gondolin house will be full before long; I'm not sure I want to try for the Khazad-dum house&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
A quick sweep over the rest of the level, and then on to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 35</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level." 
</p>
<p>
Not again&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15">  Hmm, actually, the superb feeling appears to be connected to a nearby vault; we'll come back and explore that. 
</p>
<p>
Further exploration reveals a second, smaller vault to the north of the first, one of those strange, vault-esque rooms that don't show up in v_info.txt: 
<pre>#######################

##########%^%#########^
</pre>This is after clearing out the room.  The '%' squares are where I had to punch through with Thrain's wand; I think the walls in the middle were meant to be diggable, but in Mordor they came out as undiggable mountains. The vault nets nothing of interest, except a Scroll of Acquirement&#8212;which, alas, nets a Device Trap Set that the automatizer gets to before I do.  <img src="./wiki/classic/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
The other vault is immediately below it; it's one of those maze-like rooms. Its most notable occupant is the Lernaean Hydra.  <em>[check notes]</em> Hmm, 4500hp, speed +10, 140 AC, nasty melee attacks with fire and poison damage, fire and poison breaths, assorted fire- and poison-based spells, and summon hydra and summon kin spells (wait, isn't that redundant?).  Hmm, I've got fire covered with Trone's coat; for poison, I'll fire up Poison Blood, and of course Manwe's Blessing for close combat.  On reflection, of course, I prob'ly should have done all this <em>before</em> luring it out, as all my spellcasting gives it time to summon hydras.  <em>[checks visible monsters window]</em> A 5-headed, a 7-headed, two 9-headeds and an 11-headed.  Fire and poison.  Perfect. 
</p>
<p>
"Halt, you snake-headed evildoer!  Your hoarded minions will availify you not!" 
</p>
<p>
<em>[slaps forehead]</em> The Lernaean Hydra falls in four turns, without even getting in a hit; the other hydras (hydrae?) take a single turn each. 
</p>
<p>
<em>[dusts off armor]</em> "Man, you were right, dude.  This <em>is</em> easy." 
</p>
<p>
Nothing else of great interest in the maze, so we move on to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 36</strong>: Fumblefingers quest for 13 Giant rocs 
</p>
<p>
"So, Crazy Sword Guy's back too, huh?" 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, that's one of the downsides of my strategy; with almost all our skill points used up, there's not much he can give us that will be useful.  Oh, watch that Giant roc, it's practically on top of you. 
</p>
<p>
"No prob', dude." <em>*slash slash slash*</em> <em>*thump*</em> "See?  Even that annoying little demon midget dude Grape-or was tougher than that." 
</p>
<p>
Nothing of interest this level, except: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Ring of Brast (+4), with +4 INT, DEX and speed, sustain INT and  CHA, free action and flight 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Not bad, but I can't afford to swap out either of my rings.  The reward choices for the Fumblefingers quest are Monster-lore, Weaponmastery, Combat and Divination.  Hmm, more Divination wouldn't do me any good, Weaponmastery is useless, and even Monster-lore wouldn't let me get experience from my eagles' kill; Combat it is, then. 
</p>
<p>
And that finishes the level; on to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 37</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"This level can't be all bad&#8230;"  A 3x3 small level, over quickly.  Hmm, odd thing; I just noticed that my CON somehow got docked five "percentile" points.  I was <em>sure</em> I had that maxed&#8230; oh well, here's a Potion of Constitution, which gets it back up to 18/218; looks like I'll need two more to top it back off. 
</p>
<p>
Anyway, let's move on: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 38</strong>: Fumblefingers quest for 16 Master liches (lichi? leece?) 
</p>
<p>
"You have a good feeling&#8230;"  No, not really, because this time I <em>am</em> carrying a wand they can drain.  Well, it's not irreplaceable; I'll drop it in a corner over here and come back for it later.  Don't let me forget, Bjorn. 
</p>
<p>
"&#8216;Kay." 
</p>
<p>
Two of the Master liches are in the entry room with me; the second pushes me over the top to&#8230; <em>(drum roll)</em> <em>clvl 50</em>, with all skill points going to Prayer.  My unhasted speed in bear form finally bottoms out at -15, reducing my top speed to +34.  Darn&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  The liches also dropped another Potion of Constitution, leaving me one point from max.  The third lich drops: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The metal Boomerang 'Glimdrir' (5d5) (+15,+16) (+3), with +3 DEX and  speed, poison brand, slay undead and evil, free action, resist acid, fire,  lightning, cold and sound, regeneration, anti-teleportation, and cursed 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Hmm, I <em>am</em> missing resist sound, and another +3 speed is nothing to sneeze at, but I don't like that anti-teleportation.  Enh, maybe it'll sell for a bit. 
</p>
<p>
The rest of the 3x5 small level proceeds relatively uneventfully.  A pack of assorted monsters near the southwest corner drops: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Leather Gloves 'Cambeleg' (+8,+8) [+15] (+2), with +2 STR and CON  and free action 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Small Wooden Boomerang of Driol (+15,+8), with fire and poison  brand and slay orc, giant, Xdemon, undead and evil 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
The quest reward choices are Magic, Necromancy, Mindcraft and Monster-lore; pretty much a no-brainer for Magic.  And my pack is getting kinda full, so it's time to head back: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wilderness</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"Oh!  Dude, don't forget&#8211;" 
</p>
<p>
Ah, @#$%, I <em>did</em> forget the Wand of Stone Prison, didn't I?  Ah well, as I said, it's not irreplaceable.  As long as I'm in the neighborhood, I stop by: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Minas Anor</strong> 
</p>
<p>
and sell off the randart boomerangs&#8230; oh, wait, I have to uncurse Glimdrir before I can sell it, and the Temple doesn't have any ?oRC in stock.  Ah well, let's try again in: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
All they have here is Scrolls of *Remove Curse*, but I'll make it back in proceeds from the boomerang.  And speaking of profligacy, the Black Market has a Potion of Augmentation that I buy to top off my CON again.  Next stop: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gondolin</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to stow the rest of the artifacts and pick up one of my spare Wands of Stone Prison.  Finally back home to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
where the Black Market, amusingly, is selling a Portable hole for a mere 17600gp.  A bargain at half the price, I believe the saying is&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> Back to the dungeon next time, then. 
</p>
<h4 id="head-32100c266334f645f64993263a5b62b8e0e85bbf">Part 2 of 8</h4>
<p>
Hmm, anything I need to do before heading back in? 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, dude, what're we gonna do with all these leftover bottles?" 
</p>
<p>
<em>(shrug)</em> Try any fountains we happen to find, I suppose.  They're not too heavy considering your STR, and we can always ditch them if we really need inventory space. 
</p>
<p>
"&#8216;Kay." 
</p>
<p>
Okay, then, let's return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 38</strong>, take 2 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like any other level."  Any other destroyed level, to be more precise.  I've got 74 charges left on Thrain's wand, so we should be okay for now. 
</p>
<p>
The level is uneventful, and mercifully brief; we proceed to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 39</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You feel your luck is turning&#8230;"  Still nothing of interest. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, this is getting boring, like those Barrel Downs." 
</p>
<p>
It'll get better eventually.  Let's try: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 40</strong>:  Princess quest for 12 Ancient red dragons 
</p>
<p>
"You have a very good feeling&#8230;"  There, see? 
</p>
<p>
"Uh, dude, those are fire breathers; they can't hurt me in this new coat, &#8216;member?" 
</p>
<p>
Not all their attacks are fire-based. 
</p>
<p>
<em>(shrug)</em> "&#8216;Kay, let's see what they've got." 
</p>
<p>
That's the spirit.  And here they come, just a few rooms into the level. 
</p>
<p>
"All righty, then.  Halt, you evil lizards!  Your hot will avail you not!" 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15"> Um&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"Gotta intimidate &#8216;em, dude.  Psychographical warfare and all that." 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15">  Bjorn may have been right, though; the dragons are a pushover.  I don't even bother luring them into ambushes or taking them on one at a time; I just charge.  The Gnome mages on the far side of the room were more of a hassle.  The quest reward choices are Arrows, a Lucerne Hammer, or a Tulwar; I go with the Arrows, which turn out to be 24 Arrows of Slay Undead (+9,+4).  Enh, that might sell for a bit.  The only loot of interest is a Scroll of Genocide dropped by one of the dragons.  Hmm, I take that back, the Gnomes dropped a Scroll of Acquirement, which nets a Small Metal Boomerang of *Slay Orc* (+9,+4) (+2).  Enh, again, more cash. 
</p>
<p>
No point in finishing off the level, I think; onward to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 41</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You like the look of this place&#8230;"  A lot more lava on this level; going for Trone's coat was apparently the right move.  Not much else of interest, though, except for a fountain of Healing that nets me 8 potions.  Moving on, then: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 42</strong>:  Princess quest for 5 Ancient multi-hued dragons 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  There, <em>that</em> should be a challenge. 
</p>
<p>
"Better, but still needs work.  Let's go find &#8216;em." 
</p>
<p>
Again, the dragons aren't very far in; they approach single file, punching through a pack of Ghouls.  I think I'd better fire up Manwe's Blessing for this&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, you worry too much." 
</p>
<p>
These guys I'd rather not face two at once, if it's okay with you. 
</p>
<p>
"Whatever, dude." 
</p>
<p>
The dragons aren't too much trouble; I can see via Sense Monsters, though, that I'm gonna have punch through a few more packs of monsters to get to the quest reward.  Speaking of which, the choices are a Small Metal Shield, a Bastard Sword, or a Lead-Filled Mace.  Enh; I go with the sword. 
</p>
<p>
With the dragons out of the way, I charge out of my ambush corner into the Ghouls, then punch through a pack of Cold hounds and some Water trolls to get to the quest room and retrieve my reward:  a Chaotic Bastard Sword (+10,+12).  Enh, let's see if the dragons did better&#8230; well, this Whip of Extra Attacks (+11,+3) (+1) should fetch a good price.  Hmm, the pack is getting kinda full, but I think I can go another level at least: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 43</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a very good feeling&#8230;"  Nothing of note happens, except for a Cherub that gets a few summons in before I can conjure up an eagle to take him down with.  Eventually I just scatter him and all his hordes to the winds with Teleport Away and track him down individually.  That done, we move on to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 44</strong>:  Princess quest for 14 Ethereal dragons 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  Well, that should keep us busy for a bit. 
</p>
<p>
"Nah, Ephemeral dragons aren't so tough." 
</p>
<p>
But fourteen of them at once? 
</p>
<p>
"Mm, good point." 
</p>
<p>
Sense Monsters picks up a pack of Water hounds in a nearby room to the southeast&#8212;and the quest room due north, on the far side of the level. Enh, the hounds can rot. 
</p>
<p>
Nothing worse than a swarm of Killer bees stands between me and the quest room.  As expected, two of the dragons have leaked out ahead of the pack. Fire up Manwe's Blessing and let's take it in. 
</p>
<p>
"Right.  Halt, you evil dragon-shaped clouds of gassy stuff!" 
</p>
<p>
Two more approach as I finish off the first two; the rest seem to be still stuck in the quest room.  With a little artful dancing, I manage to lure the rest out one at a time to polish them off.  The quest reward choices are White Dragon Scale Mail, Chain Mail and Metal Scale Mail. 
</p>
<p>
"I'm sensing a theme here, dude." 
</p>
<p>
Heh.  The dragon armor will probably sell for the most, so I choose it; it turns out to be White Dragon Scale Mail of Defense [+25], with sustain WIS. Now, we've got a <em>lot</em> of dragon loot to go through here&#8230; hmm, a Great Axe of Westernesse and a Quarterstaff of Extra Attacks; those should fetch decent change.  Say, what's this over in the corner&#8230; a Gas spore raw meat. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/alert.png" alt="/!\" height="15" width="15"> O-<em>kaaay</em>.

</p>
<p>
Don't look at me.  At any rate, that's my pack full; back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
where I stow the Potions of Healing from the fountain.  Hmm, the armor store has a 25Kgp cap; I think I can do better in: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Ah, yes, that's better.  I sell off my loot and stow the Scroll of Genocide in my house here, selling off some old Elven armor to make room. On the way back home to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
I acquire a fate to find a Potion of Water on dlvl 15.  Be still my heart. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  Back down the proverbial rabbit hole, then, to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 44</strong>, take 2 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like any other level."  Some Water hounds give me a bit of trouble near the start, but nothing serious.  Fast forward to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 45</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a good feeling&#8230;"  We start the level off with another jelly pit to punch through.  Not much further in, Sense Monsters picks up Adunaphel. <em>[checks notes]</em> Hmm, she's not one of the tougher Nazgul; 2700hp and speed +10. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, but she's got that make-sick touch like all the other Nose ghouls, right?" 
</p>
<p>
Yes, but Elessar activates to cure Black breath, so we don't have to worry about that. 
</p>
<p>
"Excellent!  Let's rock her bones, then.  Halt, you very quiet evildoer!" 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> And indeed she's not so tough; she falls in two turns, without laying a hand on me.  She drops nothing of note, besides: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Adunaphel's first ring, with +2 stealth, invisibility, resist sound,  nether and nexus, see invisible, slow digestion, drain exp, heavy curse and  curse-no-drop 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Another first Nazgul ring; this one will go to the Mathom house. 
</p>
<p>
From there we return to more mundane problems&#8212;like a Ranger chieftain who makes a nuisance of himself by summoning lots of monsters.  This is annoying for a while, before I remember that I can just use Recall to jump past his swarm of summons and smack him upside the head really hard for being such a pest. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
And that seems to be all the excitement the level has to scare up for me; let's see what they've got on: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 46</strong>:  Fumblefingers quest for 17 Death molds 
</p>
<p>
"What a boring place&#8230;"  No, not with a Death mold right next to me as I enter the level&#8212;and a pack of Olog-hai blocking every escape route. Thinking quickly, I Recall-swap further back into the pack and plow through the trolls and some Black puddings. 
</p>
<p>
Surprisingly, seven of the Death molds are in the starting room with me. I wonder&#8230; yep, a quick check confirms my suspicion:  this is a 1x1 small level.  <em>(shrug)</em> At least it'll go quickly.  <em>[checks notes]</em> Oh, and I have resist disenchantment now, so I suppose I could just walk up and smack &#8216;em instead of having to pelt them to death from a distance with Manathrust.  That'll make my life easier. 
</p>
<p>
"Okay, sword guy, you've <em>gotta</em> explain this to me:  how do you, like, get your sword stolen by a bunch of molds that can't move?" 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, Death molds are tricky; they can reach out with telekinetic powers and take things from you.  Indeed, legend speaks of a very rare few Death molds that have actually achieved sentience and can move about magically on errands of their own, beyond our understanding." 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15"> "Riiiight, whatever, dude." 
</p>
<p>
<em><strong>*Do not mock what you do not understand, mobile.*</strong></em> 
</p>
<p>
Ack! <em>*wince*</em>  You know, you're in a humanoid body now, <a class="external" href="./www.killerbunnies.org/angband/ladder/bob/bob_1.html"><img src="./wiki/classic/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">Qbmgzxjvwm</a>; you can speak aloud instead of using telepathy. 
</p>
<p>
<em><strong>*Bah, you mobiles and your noise-making orifices.  This is the last of my native gifts that still remains to me in this bizarre form; I will not forsake it solely because it discomforts you.*</em></strong> 
</p>
<p>
Okay, okay, could you just tone it down a little, at least? 
</p>
<p>
<em>*Hmph.  I know not why I bother with such weak-minded fools as these.*</em> 
</p>
<p>
Ooh, I bet the shopkeepers just <em>love</em> you&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
<em>*This is that strange custom you mobiles call "sarcasm," yes?*</em> 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
"Wait, what did you say that guy's name was?  Kwidge-mizzle-flip?" 
</p>
<p>
Qbmgzxjvwm.  It's pronounced "Bob." 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15"> "Dude, you just made that up." 
</p>
<p>
Yes, I did.  What of it? 
</p>
<p>
"Never mind.  So, sword guy, you said you could teach me something for getting your sword back?" 
</p>
<p>
The quest reward choices are Thaumaturgy, Symbiosis, Conveyance and Monster-lore.  Hmm, Monster-lore is useless for me, and it's too late to try pumping Thaumaturgy; how would you feel about Symbiosis, Bjorn? 
</p>
<p>
"Simba-what?" 
</p>
<p>
Symbiosis, the ability to commune with non-moving monsters like those Death molds.  You can even let them live on your body, and they'll use their attacks and their powers to help you. 
</p>
<p>
"What?!  You mean have one of those slimy moldy things stuck on my body, getting all in my fur and sucking the life out of me?  Eww, no thanks, dude." 
</p>
<p>
<em>(shrug)</em> Conveyance it is, then.  Hmm, one more of those and I'll pick up Probability Travel for free.  One last sweep over the level to pick off a couple dragons that spawned while I was hunting down all the molds, and next time out we'll continue pushing on through Mordor. 
</p>
<h4 id="head-9493fc1b2f31b39adbe7ce8e49dcb18f5c801645">Part 3 of 8</h4>
<p>
As we return, Bjorn is about to descend to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 47</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a good feeling&#8230;"  Another 1x1 small level; only notable occupant is Medusa.  <em>[checks notes]</em> Hmm, 2400hp, speed +10, annoying damage, and a smattering of bad spells, including a 10d15 cause-wounds spell and a couple summon spells.  Enh, not too tough. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, let's rock her snakes, dude." 
</p>
<p>
Medusa is sitting in the middle of a pack of Half-orcs for no obvious reason.  Hmm, I think I can use that to my advantage&#8212;use the Half-orcs to fill up space so she can't summon.  Okay, let's take this fight to her&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
Medusa wakes up as I approach, and gets in an acid-ball spell and a summon-kin spell as I'm punching through the Half-orcs.  Fortunately, I was still in the corridor entering the room when she summoned, so only two nagas got generated.  Once I reach her, she falls in two turns.  After Noxious-Clouding away the rest of the Half-orcs, I dig through the loot to find Medusa's drop:  nothing of note, besides some Elven Rhino Hide Armor [+21] with resist blindness.  Enh, that might sell for a bit. 
</p>
<p>
The rest of the level is quickly cleared, netting: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Chain Mail of Huraurth [+7], with sustain STR and CON, immunity to  cold, resist nether, random teleporation, aggravation and heavy curse 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Enh.  I think I'll pass.  Moving right along to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 48</strong>:  Fumblefingers quest for 20 Master mystics 
</p>
<p>
"This level can't be all bad&#8230;"  Oh, yes it can; two of the Master mystics are in the room as I enter, one right next to me and another just a square away.  Even worse, the level is a 3x1 small level, which means if one of these twerps summons Araneas, I've got essentially nowhere to run.  A Stone Prison would be handy right about now, but I've got a 65% fail rate on that wand, so it's a definite risk.  Well, here goes nothing&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
<em>*whew*</em> The Stone Prison, luckily, takes on the first shot.  The Master mystic next to me takes the opportunity to smack me around some, taking me down to 1085/1160hp and giving me a Severe cut. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh yeah?  Well, take <em>this</em>, kung fu guy!" 
</p>
<p>
The first Master mystic falls in two turns.  Now I just have to figure out how to take on the rest&#8230;  I toss back a !oCCW to heal the cut, then light up the level with Vision and cast Sense Monsters to find the rest of the Master mystics:

##################################################################
</pre>There are three more Master mystics in a room at the other end of the corridor to my west.  Counting the fourteen on screen, that's a total of seventeen, and I've killed one; the last two must be at the other end of the level.  Oh, and those h's are Malicious leprechauns.  They could get annoying quickly. 
</p>
<p>
Okay, to start, I'll open the northwest corner of the Stone Prison. And of course, Essence of Speed chooses <em>that</em> turn to expire, so the nearest Master mystic has time to move in and get a hit on me.  It takes me two turns to get Essence of Speed started again, in which time he attacks again; I'm down to 1082/1160hp and stunned.  <em>[slaps forehead]</em> That's right, I was gonna start Manwe's Blessing before letting him in, wasn't I? He gets in another hit while I bring that up.  It was clearly worth it, though; he falls in a single turn. 
</p>
<p>
The five Master mystics to my west have been approaching during all this, and one of them steps into place just as I'm finishing off the last one.  I take him down to one star and he flees, and the next one is about to step into his place.  On a lark, I toss a Noxious Cloud into the corner, killing the flee-er with the splash and softening up the next one.  He falls in a single turn, as do the next three. 
</p>
<p>
That takes care of the immediate problem.  I step out of the Stone Prison and Cloud the (now) three Malicious leprechauns.  The next contenders are the three Master mystics around the dog-leg corridor to my east, and two of them are already heading north to meet me.  I catch them at the corner just outside the room and ambush them.  That leaves one of them stuck in an alcove; the three to his southwest next to the Grey wraith are also awake now and look to be approaching along the same vector. 
</p>
<p>
I advance part of the way around the dog-leg to get the next Master mystic out of the alcove; he falls quickly, and one of the next three falls right behind him.  Hmm, some of those Dreads have woken up; I'll let them come to me before luring up the next two Master mystics.  Never mind, here they come anyway; looks like that Grey wraith pushed them around the corner to me.  I pick them off, intermixed with the Dreads. 
</p>
<p>
Hmm, the next five are in that big patch of lava off to my east.  It looks like I've got cover for my approach; the only access to the part they're in is near that door, and I think I can lure them out of that.  All five of them seem to be awake as I approach, picking off the last of the Dreads as I pass.  One of them makes it past the door and meets me halfway&#8212;and doesn't survive the approach, of course. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
Disaster nearly strikes as I continue my approach; I fail to notice I'm outside of my trap-detected range, and a Gravity Bolt Trap kicks me out of my careful approach&#8212;not too far, but it does give the next Master mystic line of sight on me for a moment.  Foolishly, he doesn't summon, but moves in for an attack.  And if he wants an attack, who am I to deny him? <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15">  That leaves three more in the lava area, and after disarming that stupid trap, they're easy to lure out. 
</p>
<p>
<em>*whew*</em> "Is that all of &#8216;em, dude?" 
</p>
<p>
Nope, two more at the other end of the level.  First we pick off the rest of the nearby monsters and do a quick sweep through the loot, which includes a Scroll of Mass Genocide and a Silver Rod of the Istari on which I might just stick that Rod Tip of Restoration I've been saving.  Oh, and a Portable Hole, which I leave behind.  Now, about those Master mystics&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
I proceed west along the southern corridor, picking off a pack of Cave orcs in a room just offscreen from the above screenshot.  The last two Master mystics are in one last room at the west end of the level, and one of them is already approaching, with a Grand master thief fronting for him.  Hmm, this looks like a good corner to ambush them around&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15">  The first Master mystic falls, and the second one isn't far behind.  And of course, Manwe's Blessing chooses <em>that</em> moment to expire; fortunately, the last Master Mystic got stuck in line behind a much slower Mind flayer, giving me just enough time to restart it and finish them off. 
</p>
<p>
"Now, <em>that</em> was fun, going all, like, commando tactics and stuff." 
</p>
<p>
I thought you wanted some slack-off time. 
</p>
<p>
"Nah, I'm done slacking off; now I want some action!" 
</p>
<p>
Ah, to be young and ursine again&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  The quest reward choices are Monster-lore, Weaponmastery, Spirituality and Disarming.  Bleh.  I guess I'll take Spirituailty for a small boost to saving throw. 
</p>
<p>
That last Master mystic dropped: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Amulet of Miregun (-5), with -5 searching, random teleportation and  heavy curse 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Ooh, thrilling.  Hmm, I wonder what gave me a CHA hit?  Must've been a cut attack from one of those Master mystics.  Oh well, that's what the restoration junkart is for.  My pack is getting close to full, but I think I can do another level or so.  A quick sweep of the last of the level, then, and on to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 49</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a good feeling&#8230;"  I'd feel better without that pack of Vrocks lurking nearby, actually.  Luckily, either my stealth is improving or Vrocks are very heavy sleepers; only one of them wakes up as I pick them off. 
</p>
<p>
Further in, I run into Waldern, completely by accident; I thought he was just a Water elemental.  Doesn't matter, though; he falls in three turns without touching me. 
</p>
<p>
The rest of the level proceeds without incident.  Well, okay, with one minor, annoying incident:  a Master lich was approaching, and I dropped my Wand of Stone Prison to prevent him from draining it, and an offscreen Blue dragon bat chose <em>that</em> moment to breathe on me. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/angry.png" alt="X-(" height="15" width="15">  Well, I've got one left; I'd better start looking for more spares.  On that note, we return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to stow a few things and pick up that Rod Tip of Restoration.  Then the usual town tour:  first to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
where I Mathom Adunaphel's ring, stow the Scroll of Mass Genocide, and sell off loot; next to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gondolin</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to pick up my last Wand of Stone Prison; and finally back home to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
where I check the fate I picked up on the way:  to find Nimthanc on dlvl 1. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/attention.png" alt="<!>" height="15" width="15">  Just for giggles, I think I'll go back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
and pick that off: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Dagger 'Nimthanc' (+4,+6), which is sentient, activates for frost  bolt (6d8.) every 7+d7 turns, and has frost brand and resist cold 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
I'll stow it in my home in: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gondolin</strong> 
</p>
<p>
where I'm rapidly running out of room.  Okay, let's try this again, shall we? 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
The Black Market has a Potion of *Healing* for my stockpile.  Hmm, I forgot to pump Thrain's wand back up after that last destroyed level; a quick trip to the Wizard's Spire takes care of that.  And that should cover everything; back to Mordor next time out. 
</p>
<h4 id="head-3efb5fc1619d1ba4e2dc5b0814be00a9b5e16376">Part 4 of 8</h4>
<p>
Moving right along, we return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 49</strong>, take 2 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like any other level."  I respectfully disagree; Thranduil's sense-evil is picking up a ghost pit in a room immediately to my south, with six Dreadmasters and eleven Dreads among other nasties.  I drop a Noxious Cloud on the Hill orcs clustered around my entry position and prepare to beat a hasty tactical retreat. 
</p>
<p>
"Wait, dude, hear that?" 
</p>
<p>
Indeed there's fighting going on nearby.  Sense Monsters does pick up a Mature spirit in the ghost pit, but it doesn't look like it's gonna last long.  And a few of the ghosts have starting leaking up out of the pit. Hmm, as long as they're only coming a few at once, I think we can take them&#8212;and we can always teleport out in an emergency. 
</p>
<p>
"Right.  Halt, you dead evildoers!" 
</p>
<p>
Actually, the assault isn't nearly as bad as I'd feared.  The inner walls of the pit are mountains (as I find out later when I push in to finish off the last stragglers), which ghosts can't phase through, so they could only leak out through the door in the north side of the inner room; if the door had been on one of the other sides, they might not have been able to get at me at all.  The worst part is the mind blasts from some of the ghosts, which did a number on my sanity, but between all the ghosts they drop more than enough potions to fix that up. 
</p>
<p>
"See?  You worry too much, dude." 
</p>
<p>
Whatever.  Nothing else of much interest on the level, so we fast-forward to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 50</strong>:  Princess quest for 11 Elder vampires 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  And the quest room is almost directly south of the east-west corridor I'm in.  <em>[checks notes]</em> Hmm, these guys are gonna be tough:  3400hp, speed +10, not too bad melee damage, but some nasty spells.  We've only ever faced six of them, and those were probably one at a time. 
</p>
<p>
"Nah, no problem, dude.  Let's rock their fangs." 
</p>
<p>
As you say.  I don't expect to spend too much time on the level, so I'll go ahead and light it up with Vision to get the immediate layout.  Hmm, could be worse; we've got a straight entrance on the north side.  I'd rather have more of an ambush corner to work with, but&#8230; hmm, actually, maybe I can lure them up out of the quest room to where their exit corridor intersects with the one I'm in. 
</p>
<p>
"It worked, dude, they're coming!  Halt, you evil Dracula wannabes!" 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15"> And the assault proceeds without serious incident.  The quest reward choices are an Iron Crown, Bolts or a Fumes Trap Set (?); the Bolts'll probably sell for the most, so I go with them.  Those vampires also dropped a huge load of loot, but none of it was of much interest.  The Bolts turn out to be 19 Bolts of Venom (+13,+12). 
</p>
<p>
"Uh, dude, is that a potion fountain, like, right in the middle of that boiling hot lava?" 
</p>
<p>
Yes, I was just thinking that that was an odd juxtaposition.  It turns out to be a fountain of Restore Mana, from which I net 7 potions.  There doesn't appear to be much else of interest on the level, so we move on to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 51</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like any other level."  A boring level overall, notable only for some of the loot I found:  another spare Tome of the Time, which reopens the possiblity of testing the Banishment trick, and these little trinkets: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Ring 'Alcarin' (+3), with +3 CON and speed, sustain WIS, DEX and  CON, and resist poison, shards and chaos 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Ring of Aladanian (+3), with +3 attacks, invisibility, sustain CON,  free action, and resist posion and confusion 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Both have potential as swap-ins for Imaguinon, but neither are particularly appealing:  I'd lose the +3 attack bonus with Alcarin, and invisibility is vaguely annoying for a melee type (though at this level, most monsters would probably be able to see me anyway).  My pack is full anyway, so I'll head back up and stow them: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<em>(digs through house)</em> Ya know, I think we should sell this Ring of Speed (+9); we've already got plenty of speed, and we can't swap out either of our current rings without losing something important. 
</p>
<p>
"&#8216;Kay." 
</p>
<p>
We pick up that and one of the older randart rings I haven't gotten rid of yet to make room for Alcarin and Aladanian here, then move on to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to sell everything off.  I'm not quite ready to give up on this randart ring, though; fortunately, there's another randart ring in my Bree house that's starting to look kind of anemic, so I sell that one off to make room (and as a confirmation of my judgement, it sells for a mere 8172gp). Back home from there to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
and back into the dungeon: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 51</strong>, take 2 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like any other level."  There's a pack of Multi-hued hounds next to me as I enter the level.  Have I mentioned recently that Noxious Cloud is fun? <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
After that, the only reall point of interest on the level is a greater vault (nethack building) near the southwest corner:

</pre>That W is Ren again; I've already got his first ring in the Mathom-house, so I'll probably be leaving his on the ground. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa.  I had a feeling I was gonna see him again." 
</p>
<p>
Yep, and we're gonna keep seeing him until the One Ring is destroyed. 
</p>
<p>
"Heinous, dude.  Well, it's a dirty job, but at least it's a fun one, eh? Halt, you very unclean evildoer!  I've already beaten you once; you won't get away this time!" 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15"> Most of that inner north wall is permanent, so we have to dig a long way around to get into the vault.  There are a couple charge-drainers in the vault, so I drop the Wand of Stone Prison in a corner&#8212;and this time, I inscribe my bottles with "<tt>^&gt;</tt>" so I <em>can't</em> leave the wand behind. 
</p>
<p>
The assault is straightforward at first, just killing the Death mold at the entrance and punching tediously past the traps.  As I come around to the far side of the first subroom, I find myself facing a Demonic Q and a Sorceror who summons a Monastic lich.  I duck back out of their line of sight, kill the lich, and let the Sorceror come to me; then I step back out and drop Noxious Clouds on the Q until it dies. 
</p>
<p>
The assault on the first subroom is fairly easy; a carpet-bombing of Noxious Clouds takes out most of the monsters before they even get within striking distance of me.  One Crypt thing teleports out into a nearby room, where I'll probably leave him. 
</p>
<p>
As I start taking out the rest of the subrooms, Ren wakes up and starts appraoching.  I lure him into the north door of one of the subrooms and ambush him there.  He falls in three turns, without laying a hand on me. The Lesser Balrog tailing him falls in two turns. 
</p>
<p>
After that, the rest of the vault is rather anticlimactic.  The Crypt thing that ran away has found his way back into the vault, which all in all was a very poor strategy on his part&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15">  I make a point of picking up the Wand of Stone Prison as early as possible.  A sweep through the loot yields some interesting stuff: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Ren's second ring, with +2 DEX, invisibility, resist fear, acid and  nexus, see invisible, slow digestion, drain exp, heavy curse and  curse-no-drop 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Metal Lamellar Armour of Fornon [+17], with sustain STR and resist  acid, light, dark, shards, nexus and disenchantment 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Cutlass of Armen (+8,+7), with poison brand, drain life, slay  demon, random teleporation, aggravation, black breath, heavy curse and TY  curse 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Whip of Agonde (+18,+4) (+2), with +2 WIS, fire brand, slay orc and  blessed 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Raal's Tome of Unconventional Warfare, which activates for teleport  level 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Balrilbon's Bag of Wondrous Tricks, which activates for decrease DEX 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Raal's Tormented Spirits, which activates for decrease WIS 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Well, mildly interesting, at least.  I think I'm gonna leave all of it here&#8212;well, except Ren's ring, since there doesn't seem to be a Scroll of *Remove Curse* on the level.  I also just noticed that the Tome of the Time I found earlier is Fireproof, so I can use it as the master copy and get rid of the spare back at home. 
</p>
<p>
With that done, we take one of the conveniently placed stairs to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 52</strong>:  Princess quest for 14 Nether hounds 
</p>
<p>
"You feel your luck is turning&#8230;"  Unpleasant, but surviveable.  The level is a 3x3 small level, and the quest room is more or less a straight shot to my west, in the middle of the northern edge of the level.  The assault is over swiftly, and the reward choices are Green Dragon Scale Mail, a Fumes Trap Set (?), and a Fumes Trap Set (?!).  <img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15"> Gee, Bjorn, which one do you think we should take? 
</p>
<p>
"I dunno, dude, what's a fumey trap sit?" 
</p>
<p>
<em>[slaps forehead]</em> We take the DSM, of course, which turns out to be Polished Green Dragon Scale Mail [+17].  Hmm, I think I've got room in the pack to do one more level, but we'll leave that for next time. 
</p>
<h4 id="head-2a0a4d9df854997f8d1fc8e47dd602641de483b0">Part 5 of 8</h4>
<p>
Pushing on one more level, as promised: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 53</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like any other level."  Hmm, apparently that last level was smaller than I thought.  And apparently my stealth really <em>is</em> improving; in the second room of the level, I sneak up on and kill a Greater wall monster before it can even wake up and start breeding. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
Further in, a Rotting Q catches me around a corner and summons a bunch of '<tt>z</tt>'s around me.  Not to worry, though; some of them are fairly close to the Q itself, so I Recall-swap with one of them and get the jump on the Q before it can summon anything else. 
</p>
<p>
Nothing else of interest happens, beyond finding a Scroll of Mass Genocide which might be useful later.  And that is kind of the limit of my pack space, so it's time to return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Ren's second ring, finally uncursed, I drop in the lake around Galadriel's place, just for giggles.  To my surprise, the Black Market has Power Dragon Scale Mail of Defense in stock.  Man, if my armor weren't my only source of fire immunity&#8230;  Ah well, on to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to sell off loot and stow the Scroll of Mass Genocide, then back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to return to the dungeon: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 53</strong>, take 2 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like any other level".  A 3x5 small level, with nothing of note on it; fast-forward to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 54</strong>:  Princess quest for 12 Bile Demons 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  <em>[checks notes]</em> I respectfully disagree:  3500hp, +10 speed, annoyingly high melee damage, high-powered poison and acid breaths, not to mention the ever-present summon demon spell.  And they're non-living, which means Noxious Cloud won't affect them.  And twelve of them means the lake form of the quest room, which doesn't give me much opportunity to herd them effectively. 
</p>
<p>
A troll pit near the entry room gives me something to vent my frustrations on for a bit.  As I'm finishing going through the loot, though, Thranduil's sense evil picks up the first of the Bile Demon approaching through a room to my north.  Sense Monsters picks up seven more of them apparently clustered in another room further north, next to a pack of Barrow wights. Hmm, from this position I might be able to lure them out one at a time, which would be much better on my nerves. 
</p>
<p>
The lead Bile Demon does indeed obligingly fall in three turns.  I push north into the next room, and four of the Bile Demons are still stuck in their corner; the other three seem to have wandered west looking for another approach. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, dude, you're gonna leave the level after rescuing the princess lady, right?" 
</p>
<p>
I'd planned to. 
</p>
<p>
"Maybe we should go ahead and light up the level, then, so we can see where those demons are headed." 
</p>
<p>
Great minds think alike, apparently.  One Vision spell later, we can see that the demons really <em>are</em> stuck in a corner in a room immediately to our north; the quest room is two rooms further north, on the northern edge of the level.  Hmm, from here, we should be ideally positioned to lure out the demons a few at a time, and two more of them obligingly fall in this manner. 
</p>
<p>
Hmm, I take that back; looks like the last three demons in the quest room have woken up and are headed down a straight shot south to my ambush corner.  Hmm, this could potentially cramp my style if all these demons get bunched too close to each other.  Let's see how the next few turns play out&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
The next three come out three in a row, with only one square between them. That seems to be enough, though, as I manage to take each one down before the next comes into line of sight.  The next two, though, appear to have gotten bunched up in the Barrow wights, and are coming down the pike on each other's heels.  No, false alarm; once I pick off the Barrow wight in front of them, the demons spread out a square.  The first of them summons a Nalfeshnee before I can finish him off, but thanks to the spacing (and my incredible speed&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> ), I have time to take the Nalfeshnee out too before the second Bile Demon rounds the corner. 
</p>
<p>
That leaves four Bile Demons:  three in the corner of the room to my north, intermixed with Barrow wights, and one more stuck in another corner in a corridor to the west of that room.  Waiting for the Barrow wights to percolate out at +0 speed is agonizing, but I manage to lure out two of the first three demons that way.  The third one will need a bit more coaxing&#8230; I push forward around the ambush corridor a few squares north into the corridor enough to get the third demon around the hump; fortunately, he's stuck behind another Barrow wight, because Essence of Speed ran out in the process. 
</p>
<p>
And then there was one.  I push north to the next room and west across it to where the last demon will emerge, just making it to an ambush corner in time to smack him down.  The quest reward choices are Ribbed Plate Armor, Chain Mail or a Flamberge; I go with the weapon. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, wait, how is she talking to us when we're in a completely different room from her?" 
</p>
<p>
What, you're just now noticing this?  That's happened to us several times by now. 
</p>
<p>
"Has it?  Wait, yeah, I remember, the one with the big ugly things&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, anyway, it's just game convenience.  If you want an explanation&#8230; well, maybe it's an extension of the same magic that's used to imprison her. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, yeah, that makes sense." 
</p>
<p>
A quick sweep through the Bile Demons' drop yields a bit of saleable loot. The quest reward turns out to be a Sharp Flamberge (+12,+2), which doesn't look like it's worth taking.  We push on, then, to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 55</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a good feeling."  Nothing of note on this level besides a fountain of Augmentation that nets five potions. 
</p>
<p>
"Man, these would <em>really</em> have been handy two or three dungeons ago." 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, well, they'll still sell for a bit.  Anyway, let's move on: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 56</strong>:  Princess quest for 10 Skull druj 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  Oh, no I don't; ten means they're in the trap-filled quest room with only one entrance from the east&#8212;from which I'll probably be in line of signt of all of them at once.  All in all, I've got a <em>really</em> bad feeling about this&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
In the near term, though, I've got a giant pit immediately to my south to take on, with a Lesser titan in the middle.  <em>[checks notes]</em> Hmm, 2400hp, speed +10, pretty good melee damage (all of damage type confusion), and a summon monsters spell.  Enh, we've seen worse. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, he sounds like a wuss.  Hey, come on out here and clash with <em>me</em>, ya wimp!" 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  The Lesser titan makes the mistake of not summoning anything, and falls quickly under the Noxious Cloud carpet.  No loot of interest from this pit. 
</p>
<p>
The quest room is near the east edge of the level.  <em>[check notes]</em> Only 1400hp, but speed +20, so I'm not going to get many free moves.  I could try Recall-swapping in, but the room is mostly convex and there's really nowhere I could land that wouldn't leave me in line of sight of at least half of them.  Amusingly, there's a Shadow in the room who appears to be attacking the princess. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, that is totally disrespectful.  I'm gonna go in there and smack him around for that." 
</p>
<p>
We need to deal with the druj first, Bjorn.  And here's an interesting possibility:  a Mature red dragon in the room just broke through the doors, relieving me from having to open them&#8212;and from the far end of the entry tunnel, I'm only in line of sight of two of the druj, which might give me something to work with. 
</p>
<p>
I clear out the dragon and step gingerly into position&#8212;and one of the druj summons a Mummified troll.  I get in a couple Manathrusts, doing embarrassingly little damage (and reflect a couple plasma bolts) before one of them summons an Eye druj next to me.  <em>*groan*</em> Okay, I'll risk taking out the Eye druj this turn.  I don't quite manage it, and they took advantage of the free turn to summon a Forest wight and <em>another</em> Skull druj.  Okay, this isn't working; I Phase Door out, counting on the assumption that the game doesn't allow the normal forms of teleportation to put you inside a quest room.  I end up in another room to the east of the quest room. 
</p>
<p>
"Now what, dude?" 
</p>
<p>
First we need to take care of the summons.  We use Thrain's wand to poke back into the quest room at a strategic angle, aiming for the summoned Skull druj&#8212;and find ourselves staring Time hounds in the face.  <img src="./wiki/classic/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15"> We retreat to the east room to lure in the hounds and smack them around really hard for distracting us, then go back in and ambush the summoned Skull druj.  After that, the Eje druj only takes only one Manathrust to finish off, since I'd almost finished it off that first turn. 
</p>
<p>
Okay, now what? 
</p>
<p>
"That's what I said, dude." 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, yeah.  I could Recall-swap out those two druj, but that would put me in line of sight of almost all the rest of the druj at once.  I could try casting Manwe's Call and sending in a Great eagle&#8230; <em>[sound F/X: pitched battle]</em> and he lasts all of three turns.  So much for that plan&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15">  Let's try the ranged assault again&#8230; well, that didn't work; I got another Skull druj summoned right in front of me, which has me down to 980/1200hp by the time I back out of line of sight of the other two and take it out. 
</p>
<p>
Okay, this isn't working; we need to come back with heavier firepower. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, what about those exploding potion things we left back at home?" 
</p>
<p>
Exactly what I was thinking&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
A quick pass to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to sell off loot, and then back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Khazad-Dum</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to pick up a generous ten Potions of Detonations.  On the way in thru MoM 50, I stumbled across: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Ring 'Amanglion' (+3), with +3 STR, DEX and CHA, sustain INT,  resist fear, acid and nexus, see invisible, and slow digestion 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Enh, not terribly impressive; I'll sell it off on the way back out, at: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
where, to justify my impressions, it only goes for 13421gp.  Back home to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"And next time, dudes and dudettes, those drudgy things are goin' <em>down</em>&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Um&#8230; yeah. 
</p>
<h4 id="head-2958de04bbc9dae46c7bf80b9f0e428fbc0e2fcc">Part 6 of 8</h4>
<p>
We're back, for Skull druj take 2.  My last trip to Khazad-dum leaves me with 27 Potions of Detonations; I'm taking 20 with me.  That side-trip to Khazad-dum left me with some recall-juggling to do; I'm in a hurry, though, and I've got plenty of Scrolls of Reset Recall stockpiled, so just this once I think I'll splurge and go straight back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 56</strong>:  Princess quest for 10 Skull druj, take 2 
</p>
<p>
"You have an excellent feeling&#8230;"  Well, I'm not sure you'd call it excellent, but I've <em>definitely</em> got a feeling&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15">  I immediately light up the level with Vision. 
</p>
<p>
"Wait, aren't you gonna, like, explore the level or anything?" 
</p>
<p>
This time it's personal, Bjorn; I'm only here to take down those druj. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa, fearsome.  Let's do it, then." 
</p>
<p>
Vision detects the quest room due north, a straight shot; the approach is uneventful.  Annoyingly, there's no monster inside the quest room to open the doors for us, and when we open that second door, we'll be in line of sight of four, maybe six of them.  Oh well, here goes nothing&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
As I open the door, I get a cause-cuts spell and a summoned Dreadmaster. Not as bad as I'd feared.  I duck back out of the entry passage and clear that out, then move back in for the main event.  From this position, I should only be in line of sight of two of them.  Skull druj have 1400hp, and !oDet's do on average 650 damage if they hit, so I'm hoping I'll need two or three for the first and two for the second (after it gets softened up by blast damage from the first). 
</p>
<p>
I throw the first potion&#8230; and it stops two squares sort of the druj I was aiming for. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/alert.png" alt="/!\" height="15" width="15"> <img src="./wiki/classic/img/angry.png" alt="X-(" height="15" width="15">  What is this, some kind of sick joke?  I get two more summons for my troubles, nothing of note; I back out and clear them up.  <em>[sound F/X:  source diving]</em>  Yup, apparently the maximum range of a thrown object is 10 squares, with no way to increase it (except for boulders, which doesn't do me any good&#8230;).  And I can't get within ten squares of those two druj without coming into line of sight of all ten of them.  @#$%. 
</p>
<p>
"Totally bogus, dude.  So now what?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, there is one other thing we can try&#8230;  I step back into position and cast a Teleport Away spell.  <em>*whew*</em> And it works; fully half of them go flying, including one of the two at the far end; the other summons a Dreadlord.  Well, that's a start.  I take care of the Dreadlord, and then head off in search of the five that got away. 
</p>
<p>
One I find near the south edge of the level, near a lava lake, perfectly positioned for an ambush.  The next I find near an orc pit, in one of two parallel east-west corridors, allowing me to drill through from the clean one and get a perfect ambush.  I do a quick carpet-bombing of the orc pit, then tunnel northeast toward the third druj, who's positioned rather awkwardly in the middle of a corridor. 
</p>
<p>
The fourth is to my northwest, near the middle of an empty room.  I'll just have to charge it, I guess.  I tunnel in via the nearest wall, adding a bit of a dog-leg at the end of the tunnel so that I'm not in its line of sight until I actually enter the room.  It has two turns as I move into attack position, and luckily for me it manages to waste both of them. 
</p>
<p>
The fifth is against the west wall of another room immediately to my north; a bit of creative tunneling, it's ripe for the ambush.  Of course, I don't notice that Essence of Speed has expired until I move in for the attack and it gets two spells on me, one to summon a Shade perfectly positioned to block my escape; fortunately, I manage to prevaily anyway. 
</p>
<p>
"<em>*whew*</em> I was getting kind of clusterphobhic in all those tunnels." 
</p>
<p>
It's not over yet; now we've got to go back and do the same to the other five. 
</p>
<p>
"Aw man, that's heinous&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
The quest room isn't far east from where I took on the fifth druj, and I'm quickly back in position.  This time, one of them hits me with a water ball, stunning me enough that I fail to get the Teleport Away spell off. Fortunately, that was apparently the turn they all missed, and the next casting got two of the druj, including the last one that could hit me from my vantage point.  Back off into the dungeon to find them&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
A bit of searching finds both of them near the northwest corner of the level, in rooms I'd been through looking for the first five.  Neither are next to a wall, which means I'll just have to charge them.  The first is only one square off the nearest wall, and conveniently positioned near an entrance to the room, so it's not much of a problem&#8212;except for the Undead beholder it summons right in my way&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
The second druj is positioned two squares off the nearest wall, and a bit awkward to approach; I have to do a bit more tunnelling.  It manages to be more annoying, though, by summoning a Bone golem.  Terrific, here I am in the middle of a room with a monster that can summon greater undead.  Keep your fingers crossed&#8230; <em>*whew*</em>  Fortunately it doesn't summon before I manage to kill it. 
</p>
<p>
And then there were three.  None have line of sight to me from my vantage point just outside the entry passage, but I've got line of sight on one of them; since I'm in no danger, I take my time whittling it down with Manathrusts.  A step forward brings another into my line of sight&#8212;and brings me into <em>its</em> line of sight.  With the herd thus thinned, though, I think I can now take the risk of using the Recall-swap trick to draw that one out into a more convenient position&#8212;for instance, this small side corridor off the quest room&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
As I swap out one of the druj, the other one manages to try and fail a summoning spell before I Phase Door out and loop back around to pick off its repositioned friend.  And that last druj is positioned just inside the entry passage, perfectly positioned to be leisurely Manathrusted to a well-deserved death. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, thank you brave warrior!  I feared you had forsaken me earlier." 
</p>
<p>
"Nah, I just had to, like, go get some heavier firepower.  Not that it did any good or anything, but hey, I would never forsaken a princess lady in distressitude." 
</p>
<p>
"Um&#8230; yes.  Let me reward you, then, with one of these three magical items." 
</p>
<p>
The choices are Augmented Chain Mail, a Broad Axe, or Padded Armor; I go with the axe, which turns out to be a Broad Axe of Slay Animal (+5,+13). Feh.  Normally I'd leave it, but since I'm headed back home anyway&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"Why'd we come back so soon?" 
</p>
<p>
I'd rather not have that many !oDet's on hand at once.  In fact, considering their complete lack of utility in that last quest, and considering that I still don't have resist shards, I think I'll stow them all again.  A quick check of the stores, and back to: 
</p>

"Uh&#8230; dude, there's a tree over there in the middle of the dungeon&#8212;and, like, it's <em>moving</em>&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Oh, that's just Quickbeam the Ent.  Hi, Quickbeam. 
</p>
<p>
"Hoom, greetings, fellow adventurer!" 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, so he's one of those, like, walking tree guys.  Cool.  What's up, walking tree guy?  Hey, isn't this kind of a dangerous place for you, what with all this lava and fire-breathing dragons and stuff?" 
</p>
<p>
"Hm, yes, a bit of care and caution is needed at these depths for one such as myself.  But then, not being too hasty is second nature for an Ent, eh? Hoo hoo!" 
</p>
<p>
"Uh&#8230; yeah.  (Dude, is he gonna be tailing around behind us the whole level?)" 
</p>
<p>
Well, let's see what he can do, at least. 
</p>
<p>
"Now, you had best let me enter this next room first.  There is something lurking in it&#8230; <em>*burárum*</em> something vile and unnatural.  I can smell it." 
</p>
<p>
Yes, a Demonic Q, according to Sense Monsters. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, yeah, those things are pretty heinous.  Think he can take it, dude?" 
</p>
<p>
Let's find out.  Quickbeam pushes forward into the room toward the Q&#8230; and two turns later, he's surrounded by Hezrou and the Q has escaped. 
</p>
<p>
"Heh.  Not very bright for a walking tree guy, is he?" 
</p>
<p>
Now, be nice, Bjorn.  I dismiss Quickbeam and let the Hezrou (and the Gargoyles and Nalfashnee they've managed to summon by now) come to me to be slaughtered. 
</p>
<p>
Nothing of interest beyond that; my best guess at what was supposed to be so superb about the level is a treasure pit near the west edge.  Anyway, we move on to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 58</strong>:  Princess quest for 6 Great Swamp Wyrms 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  <em>[checks notes]</em> Hmm, 4000hp, speed +10, poison breath&#8230; not too far out of line from what we've seen in Great Wyrms so far, and I've the Poison Blood spell to give me double poison resist.  The only potential for problems is that with six of them, they'll be in the reduced 'X' quest room, so if they don't break out on their own, I'll be facing three of them at once. 
</p>
<p>
I find the quest room not far to the north of my entry point&#8212;and it looks like the Wyrms have broken out, so with luck I can take them on one or two at a time.  There are also some Dreads clustered around the edge of the quest room, who net a Scroll of Genocide and a Wand of Stone Prison. Oh, good, I've been looking for a spare one of those&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
The Wyrms are fairly easy to lure out one at a time, and fall uniformly in three turns with Tactic cranked up to 'berzerker'.  The quest reward choices are a Claymore, Bolts, or a Great Axe; just for giggles, I go with the Bolts, which turn out to be 32 Bolts of Acid (+7,+10).  Enh.  The Wyrms themselves do better, dropping three DSMs of various colors and: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Dagger 'Histalari' (1d4) (+8,+11) (+4), +4 speed, frost brand,  drain life, wounding, slay undead and animal, and blessed 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Not bad; should sell for a bit.  My pack is getting kind of full, though; I finally ditch the last few Empty Bottles I was toting around to pick up a bit more loot, and return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
And the standard town tour:  first to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to stow the Genocide scrolls and sell off loot, then to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gondolin</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to stow the spare Wand of Stone Prison, and finally back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
whence we will return to Mordor next time out. 
</p>
<h4 id="head-e444f12018752e4f9813ad2ea6b3694406f4f8b5">Part 7 of 8</h4>
<p>
Once more unto the breach: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 58</strong>, take 2 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like any other level."  Some Air hounds in the same room with me as I enter&#8212;briefly&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
The centerpiece of the level (literally) is another of those clusters of cavern-like rooms carpeted with traps.  The worst this one has to offer is a Great Wyrm of Perplexity and a Grand master mystic&#8230; actually, no, I take that back; I just noticed that one of those '<tt>p</tt>'s is Saruman. <em>[checks notes]</em> Hmm, 7000hp, decent melee damage, a whole raft of nasty melee spells, including a bunch of summon spells&#8212;but he's only speed +10, so with a bit of care, we should be able to pillar-dance him. 
</p>
<p>
I don't have to deal with him yet, though; the three caverns are unconnected, so I can deal with Saruman at my leisure.  First, having swept the east cavern, I punch through to the south cavern and clear out some trolls and a Ranger chieftain, who between them drop: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Large Leather Shield 'Erente' [+11], with immunity to lightning,  free action, hold life, resist poison, confusion and sound, and reflection 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The metal Boomerang of Beor (+8,+12) (+4), with +4 DEX and speed and  resist acid, lightning, fire and cold 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Now, Saruman's in the north cavern, with a Hell knight, an Ancient green dragon, and a pack of Blink dogs; I'll prob'ly just teleport them out of the way.  First, a bit of creating digging with Thrain's wand to carve out a suitable pillar between the two caverns, then I punch through to let in the hordes.  The dragon and the Hell knight lead the assault, and get teleported away as promised; for the Blink dogs, I just lay down a Noxious cloud carpet to pick them off for me.  And then, Saruman steps up to the plate. 
</p>
<p>
"And right into my claws.  Halt, you multi-colored evildoer!" 
</p>
<p>
Heh.  The pillar trick turns out to be almost unnecessary; Saruman is solidly stunned after two rounds of attacks and dead after two more.  He drops some nice Tomes and Mage Staffs, but nothing I can use.  Of more interest is the Potion of Experience I found in a last-check loot sweep through the caverns&#8212;and considering that I'm already level 50, that really isn't of much interest either&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/redface.png" alt=":o" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
And that finishes the level; onward to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 59</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You feel your luck is turning&#8230;"  A 1x5 small level, with nothing to recommend it; fast-forward to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 60</strong>:  Princess quest for 14 Maulotaurs 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  A 3x3 small level, but I won't be going far; the quest room is immediately to my south.  <em>[checks notes]</em> I've faced off against a few of these before; 3250hp, +20 speed, decent melee damage, plasma bolt and fire ball spells, both rendered moot by Trone. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  Hmm, according to this, two of their melee attacks do shatter damage; I hadn't noticed that before.  I don't want any earthquakes happening around the princess, so I'll have to lure them out. 
</p>
<p>
That won't be too hard, though; three of them are already headed for me. They fall reasonably quickly, as do the three that immediately follow them from the other side of the quest room.  A bit of dancing lures out two more; for the rest, it looks like I'll have to take it in&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
I take the east side of the quest room first, luring out the three there into a conveniently placed corridor.  Essence of Speed fails at an awkward moment, but fortunately, all it does is give the Maulotaurs a chance to catch up to me.  I loop around to the west half, and one of the Maulotaurs meets me halfway; I lure him back into the entry room just to be safe.  The last two I lure out into another conveniently placed corridor and dispatch with&#8230; well, with dispatch. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
"So, like, what was the point of all that running around and getting all the ugly cow guys to follow us?" 
</p>
<p>
Not sure, in retrospect.  None of the Maulotaurs caused any earthquake effects, which seems odd; I find it highly unlikely that I somehow managed to kill all fourteen of them without any of them hitting me with a shatter attack.  Ah well, a mystery for another day, I suppose.  The quest reward choices are a Fauchard, a Metal Cap or a Halberd; the cap isn't likely to beat Thengel, and the weapons will probably sell for more&#8230; actually, we've already got 2.7 <em>million</em> gold by now, I think that's enough. We can't use either of the weapons, so let's try the cap.  It turns out to be a Metal Cap of Beauty [+7] (+3). 
</p>
<p>
"Don't learn, do you, lad? <em>(zizz)</em>" 
</p>
<p>
What?  It's not like we actually <em>needed</em> the money or anything.  A quick sweep over the level checking for anything interesting nets: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Metal Scale Mail 'Thodrion' [+11], with sustain STR, CON and CHA,  hold life, and resist acid and cold 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
which on reflection isn't really that interesting after all.  Onward, then, to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 61</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like any other level."  A full-sized level, finally.  Not terribly interesting, though, beyond a lesser vault (bank) near the middle&#8212;and even that isn't very interesting, except that it netted another spare Wand of Stone Prison.  Moving right along, then: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 62</strong>:  Princess quest for 5 Hru 
</p>
<p>
Now, <em>these</em> guys I've had earthquake problems with&#8230;  The level is a 1x3 small level, and Vision reveals that there is in fact no quest room here.  Hmph. 
</p>
<p>
"Wait&#8230; so if the princess lady isn't here, then, like, who was that shouting at all those hooroos?" 
</p>
<p>
A minor bug; the game prints the quest message even if it fails to actually place the quest room. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh.  Ya know, now that you mention it, she <em>did</em> actually sound kinda pre-recorded this time&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Mm.  As long as we're here, we might as well pick off this pack of Dreads and the troll pit nearby, just for kicks.  The troll pit nets: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Metal Scale Mail of Ormen [+9], with sustain STR, immunity to  lightning, and resist light, shards and chaos 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Pike 'Anwen' (+17,+8.), with acid and frost brand, chaotic effects,  drain life, slay Xdragon and demon, and blessed 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Enh, the Pike might sell for a bit. 
</p>
<p>
"I thought we weren't worrying about money anymore, dude." 
</p>
<p>
You're right, we weren't, were we?  I'll go ahead and ditch the randarts, then; Beor, though, I might be able to finagle into a future equipment combo, so I'll keep it. 
</p>
<p>
"So, what about the princess lady?" 
</p>
<p>
We'll have to leave and come back to regenerate the level.  To that end, we hop the nearest up staircase back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 61</strong>, take 2 
</p>
<p>
Hmm, I'm quite surrounded here in the entry room:  Ghouls, Rotting corpses, and some Hellhounds off to the side.  Hmm, should I just leave them and head back down? 
</p>
<p>
"No way, dude, these guys are wimps.  And those burning dogs can't hurt me anyway.  Halt, all you evildoers!" 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, okay, go ahead and take care of them; I really should Vision the level anyway, just in case there's something interesting on it&#8230; enh, a 3x1 small level, with nothing of note.  Back down, then, to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 62</strong>, take 2:  Princess quest for 5 Hru 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like any other level."  A full-sized level this time, so the quest room almost certainly got generated.  Some Inertia hounds and a Hand druj in the entry room; not an appealing combination to take on at once.  Enh, teleport &#8216;em away. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
The quest room is not far southwest from the entry room.  Hmm, these guys can tunnel through walls, so I can't stop them from double-teaming me just by luring them into a corridor; I'll have to pull them out of the quest room one at a time. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, dude, who's the guy over there with the cat ears and the tail?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, well.  The Cat Lord has shown up to play.  <em>[checks notes]</em> Hmm, 4800hp, +20 speed, pretty tough melee damage, with quite an assortment of nasty effects:  confusion, drain DEX, blindness and paralysis.  I should be immune to all of that, though, except maybe for the drain DEX, which I can always heal later.  Interestingly, my notes also say he's supposed to have an escort&#8230; <em>(casts Sense Monsters)</em> ah, there they are:  all Tigers. Looks like he just outran them in his haste to come kill me.  And from this position, the rest of the Hru (I've already killed one by this point) are pinned in the quest room, so I don't have to worry about them for now. Shall we try our luck, Bjorn? 
</p>
<p>
"You know it, dude.  Halt, you feline evildoer!" 
</p>
<p>
Heh.  His Catness falls in four turns; he gets a few hits in on me, but no drain DEX hits.  And his drop is spectacularly boring.  Back to the Hru, then.  With a bit of patience, I lure the last four out one by one and kill them in the next room over.  Not that it mattered, though; there were still no earthquake effects. 
</p>
<p>
"Were we expecting earthquakes, dude?" 
</p>
<p>
Yes, frankly; I know some of those Hru managed to hit us, and <em>all</em> their melee attacks do shatter damage.  I wonder if it's proximity to a quest room that suppresses the earthquake effect?  Ah well, never mind. The quest reward choices are a Small Wooden Boomerang, a Hard Leather Cap and a metal Boomerang.  Let's see, I think the only thing I actually <em>need</em> from the Long Bow of Bard I'm currently wielding is its free action; maybe we'll luck out and get a good randart boomerang.  I go with the metal one, for no particular reason, and it turs out to be&#8230; a metal Boomerang of Slay Troll (+10,+8.). <img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
Before we move on, let's do a quick Vision sweep of the level&#8230; hmm there's a lesser vault (nethack, tiny castle) off to the southeast, but it doesn't look like it has anything interesting in it.  Immediately to our west, there's another of those cavern-room groups with quite an assortment of annoying monsters:  Inertia hounds, Nexus hounds, Barbazu&#8212;and Akhorahil the Blind right in the middle of them all.  <em>[checks notes]</em> I don't have a ring for him yet, so it might be worth going in for him&#8230; nah, he'll be back. 
</p>
<p>
And this looks like a good enough stopping point.  Next time out, we'll push on, hopefully through the rest of Mordor. 
</p>
<h4 id="head-9e5cd4ce427a6d938518c681fc1afd5153dbad36">Part 8 of 8</h4>
<p>
When we last left Bjorn, he was just about to descend to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 63</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  Which might actually be justifiable this time, as the level sports no fewer than three lesser vaults:  a (diagonal), a (brain's lair) and a (belvoir keep). 
</p>
<p>
That last is my first target; it's mostly populated by hounds, Air and Water, with some Nether mixed in for variety.  Also of note is a pack of Cave trolls and an Ancient gold dragon.  The dragon leads the assault, and falls quickly; as per their usual annoying behavior, the hounds won't approach as long as they think I'm outside the room, so I have to step inside and carpet-bomb the immediate area with Noxious Clouds, eating a water breath in the process. 
</p>
<p>
"Aw, heinous, man, I hate when my fur gets all waterlogged." 
</p>
<p>
You'll have to deal for now, we just acquired bigger problems:  a Knight Templar I hadn't noticed before summons a Fallen angel, who in turn manages to summon a Lesser balrog before I can kill it.  I drop a Cloud on the knight's head and go back to finishing off his lackeys.  That done, I step back out of his line of sight as he approaches and smack him upside the head for being a pest. 
</p>
<p>
From there, the rest of the monsters aren't a problem.  Only one bit of notable loot, dropped by that Fallen angel: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Ring of Flare (+3), which activates for dimension door every 100  turns, grans swap position power, and has +3 STR, CON, CHA and searching,  immunity to fire, flight, see invisible, and sense thunderlord 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Hmm, if I ever <em>really</em> wanted to swap out Trone's coat, this would be a good source of fire immunity.  Wait, I just noticed that one of my Wands of Stone Prison is down to zero charges. <em>[checks message log]</em> Oh, I hadn't noticed before that Lesser balrogs have a drain-charges attack.  Ah well, under the circumstances, with him summoned right on top of me, there's probably not much I could have done about it&#8212;I'll just have to remember that for future encounters. 
</p>
<p>
Okay, next we'll move west to the (brain's lair) vault.  Sense Monsters detects little of note inside:  Gargoyles, a few Ice trolls and Earth hounds and a couple young dragons.  Bjorn, are you pondering what I'm pondering? <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
"I think so, dude, but, like, even if we could find another of those walking tree guys, I don't really think we could convince him to wear a tutu." 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/alert.png" alt="/!\" height="15" width="15"> <img src="./wiki/classic/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15"> <em>Please</em> tell me you were just playing along with the gag, Bjorn. 
</p>
<p>
"Gag?  What, was that, like, supposed to be a joke or something?" 
</p>
<p>
<em>*shudder*</em> Never mind.  Clearing the vault is easy enough not to merit a play-by-play.  Again, only one bit of notable loot, this time dropped by one of the dragons: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Gauntlets of Eol [+15](+60%) (+3), which activate for mana bolt  (9d8.) every 7+d7 turns, can store a spell, and have +3 INT and luck, +60%  mana, free action, and resist lightning, poison and dark 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Man, if only I had hands&#8230;  Anyway, that leaves just the (diagonal) vault to take care of.  Quite an assortment of monsters in this one according to Sense Monsters, but nothing particularly challenging.  The loot is correspondingly low-grade&#8212;though a chest did cough up another Portable Hole. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
Well, that was fun; onward to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 64</strong>:  Princess quest for Ungoliant the Unlight 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  Now, <em>this</em> could be interesting&#8230; <em>[checks notes]</em> 13000hp, speed +20, moderately tough melee dmage, poison and darkness breaths, and a summon-spiders spell.  Urk. No, I don't really feel so superb about this&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
The level turns out to be a 3x3 small level; the quest room is on the far corner of the level from where I entered.  Before I find it, though, a Mature bronze dragon drops: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Amulet 'Tatarama' (+3), with +3 STR, WIS and infravision, sustain  INT, resist cold, blindness and shards, and slow digestion 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Enh, I'm unimpressed; leave it. 
</p>
<p>
And now for Ungoliant.  According to Sense Monsters, there's a Great Storm Wyrm and an Iron golem in the outer ring of the quest room.  I'd really rather not have to fight them and Ungoliant at once; I'll try to teleport them away as I approach.  The quest room itself is in the southeast corner, and with one monster, it's the lava-moat form, with a door on the east side, so at least I have a safe approach from the west.  I fire up Manwe's Blessing and Wind Shield and begin my approach. 
</p>
<p>
Ungoliant wakes up as I approach.  Neither of the other monsters do, though, and the Storm Wyrm is positioned so that I can't get into line of sight of him without letting Ungoliant out.  No problem, though; once the Iron golem's taken care of, I wake up the Wyrm with a Noxious Cloud splash and teleport it off to parts unknown.  Which just leaves Ungoliant&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"All right, let's rock her webs, dude.  Halt, you evil spider thing!" 
</p>
<p>
The first round of combat knocks Ungoliant down one star.  Not good.  She does seem to be stunned for the moment, at least, so I can keep whittling her down.  After two more turns, she's down three stars and I'm barely scratched.  Hmm, I think we can pull this off&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"That's the spirit, dude!" 
</p>
<p>
Another seven turns of knocking her down one star at a time eventually does the trick.  She did get in some hits on me, but not too much; I ended up at 982/1200hp, with a slightly lowered STR.  I noticed she tried to heal herself a few times, but it didn't seem to do much good.  <em>[checks notes]</em> Well, no wonder; the heal-self monster spell heals mlevel*6 hit points, which works out to 450 in Ungoliant's case&#8212;not even noticeable for Ungoliant. 
</p>
<p>
"Man, talk about your wimpy healing spells.  What a waste." 
</p>
<p>
Indeed.  The reward choices this time out are Metal Brigandine Armor, a Fur Cloak, and a Tome of the Tree (!).  Hmm, my current cloak is just an Elven Cloak of Stealth; maybe we can upgrade it with&#8230; a Fur Cloak of Immolation [+13].  Feh, we've already got fire aura from Trone's coat; leave it. Ungoliant drops quite a collection of Tomes, including, of course, a Tome of the Tree&#8212;none that we can use, though.  Let's move on, then: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 65</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  Yeah, yeah, seen it, taped it, taped over it.  Hmm, purple stairs nearby&#8230; that's right, this is the level where Mount Doom branches off from Mordor. 
</p>
<p>
"'Mount Doom'?  Sounds like the sort of thing some lame-o supervillain would name his secret lair or something." 
</p>
<p>
You're not far off, actually.  But we don't have to worry about that for now.  The level is mostly boring; the only reedeming feature is a lesser vault (Karnak, part II).  Sense Monsters detects mostly boring monsters, the worst being a Jabberwock and an Eye druj perfectly positioned for Manathrust attrition. 
</p>
<p>
The assault isn't as easy as I'm making it sound; by the time I punch through the lead wave of Ghouls and Light hounds (and a Gravity hound, I think) and take out the Jabberwock, I'm down to 827/1200hp&#8212;and for no reason I can divine, I'm down to +17 speed.  The rest of the nearby monsters aren't dangerous, though, giving me time to let Essence of Speed run out and recast it, which seems to clear up the problem. 
</p>
<p>
After that, the vault is fairly easy; the trickiest part is finding an approach to the Eye druj that doesn't cross its line of sight.  The loot from the vault is equally unimpressive; the only thing of note is yet <em>another</em> Portable hole. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, this portable hole thing, is that like in the cartoons, where, like, the goodguy slaps the hole on the wall and jumps through, and then when the badguy tries to follow him, he slams into the wall, like the hole was just painted on the wall or something?" 
</p>
<p>
Nope, not a thing like that.  It's a leftover bit of legacy from many versions ago, that can only be used by a class that hasn't existed for several versions. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh.  Bogus, dude.  &#8216;Cause that cartoon thing would've been <em>way</em> cool." 
</p>
<p>
I suppose.  Anyway, we're done here; let's move on to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mdr 66</strong>:  Fumblefingers quest for 9 Greater titans 
</p>
<p>
"You have an excellent feeling&#8230;"  No, I don't; my entry point is in a corridor just outside the entrance to a room to my west, and four of the Greater titans are visible in said room from my position.  And that can only mean&#8230; yep, another 3x1 small level.  Let's see what I'm up against: <em>[checks notes]</em> 3800hp, +10 speed, nasty melee damage, a summon monsters spell and a teleport-to spell.  I could probably take them one at a time without too much trouble, but not four on one.  Well, the Stone Prison strategy worked for the Grand master mystics, let's give it another shot. 
</p>
<p>
This time it doesn't work so well; it takes six tries to get the wand to work, by which time the Titans have summoned&#8230; wait for it&#8230; a Grand master mystic, who further manages to add insult to injury by summoning Araneas. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  By the time I finally get myself sealed in, I've got the Grand master mystic on one side of me and one of the Greater titans on the other, and I'm down to 970/1160hp. 
</p>
<p>
Okay, as a first pass, let's teleport these two away.  This gives me a chance to catch my breath and figure out how to handle this.  By the time I'm rested up, all three of the remaining Greater titans are hovering on the other side of the wall trying to get at me.  Good thing they can't tunnel.  Hmm, let's light up the level and see what I'm up against&#8230; okay, the titan and mystic I teleported away are in a corridor on the east end of the level.  The other five Greater titans are in a room to the west of the room the first three are in&#8212;and immediately to the south of that room is a room with <em>another</em> Grand master mystic.  And I was hoping finishing Mordor would be a simple sweep&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"<em>*cough*</em> Uh, dude, it's gettin' kinda stuffy in here&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Tough, deal; I gotta come up with a plan.  Let's see, the Greater titans' teleport-to spell means they could potentiall pull me into the room with them, which would be disastrous.  I think we need a more elaborate approach:

#################%%#%%###############%%%#######
</pre>This is just before I poke open the last square in the "zipper" path, to my northeast.  This way, a teleport-to spell can at most move me a couple squares down the zipper path&#8212;and since there'll probably be another monster behind the titan in the square he'd be trying to teleport me to, he shouldn't be able to move me at all.  At least I hope that's how it works&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
At any rate, I fire up Manwe's Blessing and Wind Shield, finish the tunnel, and step back a few squares into the tunnel for safety.  The three titans in the room lead the charge, and fall in three turns each.  Most of the summoned monsters in the room follow me into the tunnel for similar treatment, but the Araneas, as usual, linger in the room waiting for me to come to them.  Fortunately, one of the monsters dropped a Scroll of Mass Genocide, which neatly takes care of the problem. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15">  A quick sweep through the first piles of loot reveals that one of the titans dropped: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Long Bow 'Belthronding' (+20,+22) (+3), with +3 DEX, stealth and  shots and resist disenchantment 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Now, let's see if I can do the same to the five in the next room.  Sense Monsters reveals that three of them are already headed out of their room toward me as I approach.  Good, I can lure them back into my existing zipper tunnel, where they again fall in three turns each.  Pushing forward again into the near room wakes up another of the titans, who meets the same fate. 
</p>
<p>
The last Greater titan in the far west room still hasn't woken up.  Since there's only one of him left there, I don't have to worry so much about the zipper tunnel; I just need to lure him out into the corridor and ambush him around the dog-leg.  And pushing into the dog-leg seems to be enough to rouse him.  Annoyingly, I also wake up an Ethereal drake, who proceeds to start heading through the walls toward me; I'd really rather not have to fight it and the titan at once.  Fortunately, the titan outruns the dragon nicely, giving me plenty of time to finish them off one at a time. 
</p>
<p>
And then there was one.  The approach to the last Greater titan is ideal for an ambush, as you can see here:

</pre> The problem is that Grand master mystic right behind him; he's got +20 speed, which means if I'm not careful, he could catch up to the titan and slip around the dog-leg with him, and I'd have to fight both at once.  This will take some clever dancing&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
Okay, scratch that; the Grand master mystic got past the titan around a corner and is coming in first.  <em>*groan*</em> Okay, not a problem; I'll keep the titan pinned in the concave part of the corner and let the mystic come all the way up first.  He falls in two turns.  Finally, I jig the titan around the corner, lure him in, and smack him down. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, that was way cool!  Just like with those kung fu guys a few levels back, we get all commando tactics and stuff." 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  I'm gonna have an ulcer before this is over.  And we haven't even <em>gotten</em> to Angband yet.  Anyway, the ever-solicitous Mr. F. Fingers offers us Magic-Device, Archery, Stealth or Disarming.  And considering those heart-stopping few moments at the beginning of the level when my Wand of Stone Prison failed five times in a row, I think Magic-Device is the obvious choice. 
</p>
<p>
And that's it, boys &#8216;n girls, I am <em>so</em> outta here: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Okay, first order of business:  Thrain's wand is down to 62 charges, so I need to heat that back up to 155.  Hmm, I wonder how much I can put into this dead Wand of Stone Prison before it blows up&#8230; well, I made it up to 5 charges, and I think I'm gonna quit while I'm ahead. 
</p>
<p>
Now, I need to stow these artifacts somewhere.  Let's see, in: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
I can sell off a couple weak randarts and that old Harp of Power to make room for Eol, Belthronding and Beor, and in: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gondolin</strong> 
</p>
<p>
I can sell off some Elven armors, the old Drum of Power and the Dwarven Lantern of the Magi from the Eol quest to make room for Flare and the spare Wand of Stone Prison.  And finally back home to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
for a well-deserved rest. 
</p>
<p>
"So, where to next, dude?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, there are a last few quests I haven't taken on yet, and then it's time to take it to the Necromancer&#8230; 
</p>
<h3 id="head-41b0f69b19bec09201ebc5e2326cf94315c29d07">INTERMISSION:  Hard Core II</h3>
<h4 id="head-50199506ffa5a9311e5d01c13576464e7a5a2a70-2">Part 1 of 2</h4>
<p>
<em>(stretches)</em> "Ah, that was a good rest.  So, where to next, dude?" 
</p>
<p>
Next we're going to pick off the last few big quests.  First up is the Nirnaeth Arnoediad quest. 
</p>
<p>
"Whuh?  Ninnith Arnold?" 
</p>
<p>
Nirnaeth Arnoediad.  Turgon's army are trying to retreat to Gondolin, and Morgoth's troll forces have them trapped; we need to punch a path through the trolls for the goodguys to escape. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa.  This Gondola place must be really popular, what with everyone trying to invade it and stuff." 
</p>
<p>
Um&#8230; yes.  Anyway, I'm going to pick up some Potions of Restore Mana just in case, and then move on to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gondolin</strong> 
</p>
<p>
On the way, we pick up a fate to meet a Snaga on level 1. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, what <em>is</em> it with these fates?  It's like, 'You are fated to have a ham sandwich for lunch tomorrow' and stuff." 
</p>
<p>
They're not always boring.  Consider yourself lucky we haven't gotten a death fate.  But never mind that now, I need to settle on a strategy for the quest.  I've only done this quest once before, with <a class="external" href="./www.killerbunnies.org/angband/ladder/lil/lil_2.html"><img src="./wiki/classic/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">Lil</a>, and my notes don't describe how she did it; I'm assuming she just carpeted the area with Noxious Clouds from her wand. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, sounds about right." 
</p>
<p>
What, you don't remember?" 
</p>
<p>
"Hon, that was almost a year and half ago.  It's not <em>my</em> fault you don't take me out that often&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
"Uh-oh.  Dude, you'd better buy her flowers or something, she sounds pissed." 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15"> What an entourage I'm stuck with&#8230;  <em>Any</em>-way, that seems like a viable strategy for us, too. 
</p>
<p>
"I dunno, dude, like, we could go through a lot of mana that way&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
That's why I brought the !oRM, in case we need a lot of mana fast. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh.  &#8216;Kay." 
</p>
<p>
So, with all that out of the way, we go through the usual power-up sequence, fire up Manwe's Blessing and Wind Shield, and dive headfirst into: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Nirnaeth Arnoediad</strong> 
</p>
<p>
The front row of Olog-hai and Cave trolls gets the first Cloud right in the face, and are the first to fall.  And amazingly, except for a couple War trolls that got caught in that first cloud, <em>nothing</em> wakes up. <em>[checks character screen]</em> I swear it says my stealth is Bad. 
</p>
<p>
"No sweat, dude, we just gotta do it real quiet-like.  Let's see, let's do those ugly ones to the east next.  Ha!  Take <em>that</em>, you evil goodguy-army-blocking troll dudes!" 
</p>
<p>
Hang on, I see movement&#8230; yep, that's what I was afraid of:  the Hru are awake, and the nearest one just hit the edge of our Clouds. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, you worry too much.  We've dealt with these hooroo guys before." 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, I just don't want them waking everyone else up. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh&#8230; can they do that?" 
</p>
<p>
I'd rather not find out.  We manage to stun the first one long enough to kill him unscathed; a few of the nearby trolls wake up in the process, but they're easily dispatched.  Okay, make that more than a few; most of the second line of War trolls seem to be on the move now.  The second Hru comes in amongst them, and falls in four turns.  And now I've got two more Hru approaching from the south, right next to each other. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/attention.png" alt="<!>" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, use the wand of go-directly-to-jail." 
</p>
<p>
No good, Hru can tunnel through a Stone Prison.  I'll just have to brazen it out and hope I can keep them both sufficiently stunned by alternating turns attacking them&#8230; wow.  Bearform-combat really <em>is</em> all that and the proverbial bag o' chips.  By this point, though, I'm kinda surrounded by War trolls, and I've got another Hru approaching from the southeast, with one of the Eldraks from the center cluster right behind him. 
</p>
<p>
"Ah, this is nothin', dude.  We've clobbered worse crowds than this." 
</p>
<p>
Oh, I'm not throwing in the proverbial towel just yet.  Let's see, first let's drop a Cloud on the incoming Hru to soften him up a bit; then let's back up into the northwest corner to limit the number of trolls that can get at me at once. 
</p>
<p>
The fifth Hru manages to get in some hits on me, taking me down to 996/1200hp; he falls in only three turns, though, having crossed more Clouded territory than those who came before.  The Eldrak is right behind him, and falls in a single turn. 
</p>
<p>
<em>The Olog Priest points at you and curses horribly.  There is a malignant black aura surrounding you&#8230;</em> 
</p>
<p>
"Hey!  Watch your language over there, troll-breath!" 
</p>
<p>
Rr, where <em>is</em> that Olog Priest&#8230; oh, there he is, to the south. Okay, eat poison, fang-face.  Hmm, we've got another Eldrak approaching from the southeast; he's already pretty badly weakened, though, and again falls in a single turn. 
</p>
<p>
And that's all the trolls in the immediate vicinity; time to push in a few rows.  Most of the next batch don't even make it to me before dying in the Cloud.  Hmm, there's a purple '<tt>T</tt>' coming in through the center&#8230; ah, that's Ulik.  <em>[checks notes]</em> Let's see, 3500hp, +20 speed, <em>vicious</em> melee damage, mostly shatter attacks.  Though I noticed that the Hru that hit me a minute ago didn't cause any earthquakes, even though all his attacks connected; I think I must be right that quest levels block the earthquake effect.  Still&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"Ah, he's not much tougher than the hooroos we've already butt-kicked. Come on over here and face me, <em>Ug</em>-lik!" 
</p>
<p>
<em>*wince*</em> I'll just hold my ground for now and let everything come to me through the Cloud carpet.  Ulik hasn't taken much damage by the time he reaches me; here goes nothing&#8230; well, that wasn't so bad; he manages to knock me down to 977/1200, but he falls in three turns. 
</p>
<p>
"Toldja, dude.  You worry too much." 
</p>
<p>
Yes, so you keep saying.  Nothing problematic in the rest of this batch of monsters, except a couple Eldraks that probably won't survive the approach; time to push out the front line a little further.  The last two Hru come into view as I complete the sweep, side by side&#8212;looks like I'll be going for a repeat of the two-fer.  And as far out as I've pushed my Cloud curtain, I think I can do another extension sweep before the ones I just woke up even get to me. 
</p>
<p>
Only the Hru make it to me alive, and by the time they reach me, they've separated enough that I have time to take out one before the other reaches me.  And that's everything I can target from this position; I'll have to push forward to get the last of &#8216;em.  Hmm, looks like most of them are already awake.  So much for our vaunted stealth, eh, Bjorn? 
</p>
<p>
"Oh yeah, I was having so much fun beating up the troll guys, I, like, forgot to be quiet.  Sorry, dude." 
</p>
<p>
&#8216;Sokay, they'll never reach us through the Cloud carpet anyway, and we've already taken out the worst the quest has to offer, except for the three Ancient green dragons in the far corner.  We'll push the Cloud frontier a little further out, though, just on principle.  Oops, there went Essence of Speed; gotta start that back up. 
</p>
<p>
And speaking of Ancient green dragons, they've just come into view in the southeast corner as I push forward; I fire up Poison Blood just in case, and then push the Cloud frontier out to cover them.  Oops, my mana just went redline&#8212;254/517 (I have the warning threshold set at 50 percent; maybe a bit high, but it works for me).  I think we're okay, though, that should be the last spells we need to cast for a while. 
</p>
<p>
And one last push through the dragons and the last of the trolls (notably including an Eldrak Chieftain), and the quest is done. 
</p>
<p>
"That wasn't so hard, dude.  We coulda' done that earlier." 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, yeah&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, wait, what about the goodguy army?  How're they, like, gonna get through all our gassy spell stuff?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, since we've just killed all the badguys in the immediate vicinity, they have the luxury of simply waiting for our Noxious Clouds to expire&#8212;as some of the earlier ones already are. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, good.  &#8216;Cause that woulda' been <em>really</em> embarrassing and all, killing all these badguys but messing up the whole point of the quest." 
</p>
<p>
Indeed.  A sweep through the dropped loot reveals nothing of note, except that I was wrong about not needing any more mana&#8230;  That done, we return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gondolin</strong> 
</p>
<p>
where Turgon in his gratitude gives us lots of money and access to the royal jewelry shop. 
</p>
<p>
"Did he give us money, dude?  We've got so much I can't tell.  Whoa, was there a store there when we went in?" 
</p>
<p>
That's the royal jewelry shop, or the Rare Jewelry Shop, as the game would have it.  That's what I was most interested in anyway.  Time for some window shopping&#8230; hmm, Rings of Speed, Amulets of Telepathy, nothing great at this stage of the game.  We'll have to keep an eye on this shop for potential randart jewelry. 
</p>
<p>
"What next, dude?" 
</p>
<p>
We'll save that for next time&#8230; 
</p>
<h4 id="head-32a7afd88348b06542a79f18c3377d41272a6ad5-2">Part 2 of 2</h4>
<p>
With the Nirnaeth Arnoediad quest under our belt, we move on to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Minas Anor</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to do the: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Last Alliance quest</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"So&#8230; then that last quest was, what, the Second-to-Last Alliance?" 
</p>
<p>
<em>[slaps forehead]</em> Basically we just need to get from Minas Anor to Gondolin and back; we'll be ambushed by Thunderlords somewhere along the way. 
</p>
<p>
"Doesn't sound so tough.  We've taken on the giant bird rider dudes before." 
</p>
<p>
Fifty at once? 
</p>
<p>
"Oh.  Good point." 
</p>
<p>
That's mainly what I'm worried about; we're covered from their fire breaths by Trone's coat, but they can still gang up on us.  Plus there's gonna be a Gold Thunderlord in the mix, with a summon-Thunderlords spell, which could make things worse.  I think Lil got Marda summoned on her when she did this quest. 
</p>
<p>
"Ouch.  Say, that reminds me, how <em>do</em> giant birds breathe fire anyway?" 
</p>
<p>
I could tell you, but Anne McCaffrey's lawyers would sue me. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa, heinous, dude&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Let's move on, then.  The Thunderlord ambush strikes about two-thirds of the way to Gondolin. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, that was that Troan dude talking, wasn't it?  I thought we killed him." 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, we're doing the quests out of chronological order again; I assume we were supposed to have done this one before doing the Sacred Land of Mountains. 
</p>
<p>
"Man, that's a <em>lot</em> of giant bird rider dudes over there.  What're we gonna do?" 
</p>
<p>
We've only got a few turns to power up before they breach this row of trees between us and them.  This quest was a <em>lot</em> easier in earlier versions, when flight didn't allow monsters to pass trees&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"We're not gonna just let &#8216;em gang up on us, are we?" 
</p>
<p>
No, we're going to try the Stone Prison trick again.  One step south to make room between us and the trees, and&#8230; <em>*whew*</em> two tries to cast the Stone Prison, just as the lead Brown was about to get next to us. 
</p>
<p>
"Ha!  Take <em>that</em>, you traitorous giant bird rider guys!  Now what, dude?" 
</p>
<p>
Now we've got a moment to fire up Manwe's Blessing and plan our next step. Okay, they can fly over the trees, but they can't get line of sight through them, so the best place to open the Prison will be the northwest corner, with trees all around it.  A Brown comes in first, and falls in two turns. 
</p>
<p>
From there it's just a matter of attrition for a while.  The only slight flaw in my plan is that two of the Thunderlords are Spectral (which, if you think about it, is silly&#8212;even Trone's not stupid enough to include ghosts in his army). 
</p>
<p>
"Maybe not, dude; maybe now that he's dead and all, he's, like, sending some of his dead buds back from beyond the grave to smite us and stuff." 
</p>
<p>
Or maybe not.  Anyway, the two Spectrals are only a Blue and a Green, and they have the courtesy to breach my Prison one at a time.  The only thing that's got me worried at this point is the Gold; I just noticed she's got a teleport-to spell and a teleport-away spell, either of which could yank me out of my safe Prison.  Fortunately, she casts neither spell in the two turns it takes her to die. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
Once she's down, none of the rest of them can really challenge me.  And with very little room for loot to fall in the vicinity, it ends up piled twenty-three deep below me and the ex-Thunderlords.  More convenient to sift through, at least&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  Nothing of note in the loot, except: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Trident of Wrath (+16,+18.) (+2), with +2 STR and DEX, chaotic  effects, slay Xundead and evil, resist light and dark, see invisible, drain  mana and blessed 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Flail 'Totila' (+6,+8.) (+2), which activates for confuse monster  every 15 turns and has radius-1 light, +2 stealth, fire brand, slay evil,  and resist fire and confusion 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
<em>You feel your body fade away.</em> 
</p>
<p>
"Gah!  Dude, what happened?  Am I fading?  Is this the end?" 
</p>
<p>
Don't panic, I'm checking&#8230; well, nothing untoward is showing up, and we can't pass through the Stone Prison walls, so we haven't been deincarnated or anything like that.  <em>[sound F/X:  source diving]</em> Oh, that's the message for temporary invisibility.  I must've fat-fingered the macro for the Invisibility spell.  <em>[casts Greater Identify on self]</em> Odd, it doesn't say I'm invisible. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, and I'm not see-through like all the ghost things in Manwe god dude's temples." 
</p>
<p>
Well, no apparent harm done, then.  Exiting the quest level and returning to the overland map puts us below the southern tip of the Misty Mountains. Odd, I was <em>sure</em> we were further north than that&#8230;  Anyway, on the way to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gondolin</strong> 
</p>
<p>
I do get the "You are no longer invisible" message, so I must indeed have been invisible there for a while.  I stow Totila and the Trident of Wrath in my house and check in with Turgon, who promptly gives us the bum's rush with an admonition to hurry back to Minas Anor. 
</p>
<p>
"Totally rude.  I didn't even get a chance to ask if all his army dudes got back okay." 
</p>
<p>
I'm sure they did.  Come on, let's go. 
</p>
<p>
"We're not, like, gonna get ambushed again, are we?" 
</p>
<p>
Nope.  The trip to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Minas Anor</strong> 
</p>
<p>
is blissfully uneventful, and Aragorn rewards us with the Golden Horn of the Thunderlords. 
</p>
<p>
"Well, <em>that's</em> new.  I certainly didn't get anything nice like that when I did this quest." 
</p>
<p>
Now that you mention it, Lil, I don't remember that either.  <em>[sound F/X: more source diving]</em> Looks like it was added in 2.2.0. 
</p>
<p>
"There, see what happens when you take so long to finish up a character? I'm missing all the cool stuff." 
</p>
<p>
You're an Alchemist, Lil, you're hardly lacking for cool stuff&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"So, like, what's this horn thing do, anyway?" 
</p>
<p>
It summons a Thunderlord to carry you back to town.  Basically it's identical to your Recall spell, except it kicks in immediately.  Useful as an absolute-last-ditch escape. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh.  Enh, I've got teleport spells and the switcheroo trick for that. Wait, was that glowing thingy there before?  It looks kinda like the glowing tunnel thingies in the dungeon." 
</p>
<p>
That was indeed the whole point of the quest:  to create a void jumpgate between Minas Anor and: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gondolin</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa!  How'd we get back to Gondola so fast?" 
</p>
<p>
I just told you, a void jumpgate.  The one we just got through helping to create. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa.  Excellent, dude.  Talk about your rapid transit." 
</p>
<p>
I stow the Horn of the Thunderlords in my house here and then hop the void jumpgate back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Minas Anor</strong> 
</p>
<p>
whence it's a shorter hop back home to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"That was fun, dude.  Any more quests we can do?" 
</p>
<p>
I think that's the last of the side quests; our next job is to take on Dol Guldur&#8230; 
</p>
<h3 id="head-55e67ce466043ae6706e6ca734eae2ecfd39b114">CHAPTER 9:  Towering Inferno</h3>
<p>
As promised, this time we'll be heading to the Tower of Dol Guldur to take on the Necromancer. 
</p>
<p>
"Heh heh.  Sounds kinda kinky, dude." <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
<em>*groan*</em> No, not "neck romancer", <em>Necromancer</em>. 
</p>
<p>
"Vhat?  Vhat?  I'm here, already, vhat do you vant?" 
</p>
<p>
<em>[slaps forehead]</em> I shoulda seen <em>that</em> coming a mile away&#8230; <em>*sigh*</em> Ladies and gentlemen, <a class="external" href="./www.killerbunnies.org/angband/ladder/scrig/scrig_5.html"><img src="./wiki/classic/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">Scrig</a>, my Vampire Kobold Necromancer.  What are you doing here, anyway?  And what's with the fake Bela Lugosi accent? 
</p>
<p>
"Vell, how else are yourr readers supposst to know dat it's me talking und not yourr Smokey de Varper?" 
</p>
<p>
Easy:  you don't say "dude" and "like" every third word. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude!  I, like, totally resent that implication." 
</p>
<p>
See? 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa, wait a minute, dude; if we've got this Necro-whatever dude here, why do we need to go to this Dull Golden Tower or whatever?  Why can't we just take him here? 
</p>
<p>
Because this isn't <em>the</em> Necromancer, just <em>a</em> Necromancer. 
</p>
<p>
"Yes, didn't you hearr I comm in six-pakks?" 
</p>
<p>
Besides, the Necromancer isn't really a Necromancer anyway, he's more of a sorceror. 
</p>
<p>
"Then&#8230; like, why isn't he called 'The Sorceror'?" 
</p>
<p>
<em>*groan*</em> Let's just say he's incognito. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh.  Yeah, that makes sense, I guess.  No one would figure it'd be him with a name like that." 
</p>
<p>
"Dizzying intellekt, dis vun.  Vhere did you find him?" 
</p>
<p>
Long story.  Come on, let's go, Bjorn. 
</p>
<p>
"&#8216;Kay.  What's this tower like, anyways?" 
</p>
<p>
Kinda like Moria, but with a wider monster distribution, and no water streamers.  Oh, and all the levels are small. 
</p>
<p>
"Hmm, that could be bad if we run into Crazy Sword guy.  Remember the trouble we had with those kung fu guys on a small level." 
</p>
<p>
Not to worry, no random quests in the Tower.  So, then, onward to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>TDG 57</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  Not this again&#8230;  A 3x5 level, and I'm surrounded by Vrocks the minute I enter the level. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/attention.png" alt="<!>" height="15" width="15"> Fortunately, they stay asleep while I power up and start clobbering them. Unfortunately, a pack of Dreads wanders in from the northwest, including a Dreadmaster.  I risk taking some hits from the Dreads and the few Vrocks that have woken up by now to push through to the Dreadmaster, who falls gratifyingly quickly.  After that, the opening onslaught is handled with dispatch&#8212;most of the Vrocks don't even wake up. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, what <em>is</em> this nasty water?" 
</p>
<p>
Ah, yes, tainted water seems to be one of the common terrain features in Dol Guldur.  I think it's harmless. 
</p>
<p>
"Speak for yourself, dude; I don't think this smell is <em>ever</em> gonna come out of my fur&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Poor long-suffering Bjorn&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  At any rate, the level passes without further incident.  I do find a Metal Cap of Seeing with telepathy, which might be handy as a swap-in at some future point.  Onward, then, to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>TDG 58</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level."  Yup, here we go again.  A 3x3 level, with nothing to recommend it.  Fast-forward to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>TDG 59</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a very good feeling&#8230;"  Another 3x3 level, nothing of note besides: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Guisarme of Landil (+4,+5) (-6), with -6 WIS, slay Xdragon and  Xundead, aggravation, Black Breath, heavy curse, and TY curse 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
<img src="./wiki/classic/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15">  <em>[checks notes]</em> Hmm, Dol Guldur only goes down to level 70; this could be quick.  On that note, we move on to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>TDG 60</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You feel your luck is turning."  A 1x1 level, and thus over quickly.  I do manage to score a Staff of Genocide, though, which could come in handy later.  Moving right along, then: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>TDG 61</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like any other level."  See, that's how fast that last level went. This level, by contrast, is 3x5, so it'll take a bit longer.  It also includes my first ever Behemoth with any character.  <em>[checks notes]</em> Hmm, 5000hp, speed +10, decent melee damage, breathes fire&#8230; enh, we've beaten tougher monsters than this.  Plus it's aquatic, so it can't leave the water squares it's in. 
</p>
<p>
"Lame-o, dude.  Halt, you big ugly wet hulking thing!" 
</p>
<p>
Heh.  The rest of the level is uneventful, and we continue to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>TDG 62</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have an excellent feeling&#8230;"  No, not really; I've got a Death drake immediately to my south, a Q not far off to my north, and a few other monsters of note nearby.  A brief assault, though, and they're all taken care of.  The level is 3x3 and, beyond the mildly amusing synergy of a Green Thunderlord dropping a Great Scimitar of the Thunderlords, passes without note.  Oh, there was also the the Scroll of Summon Never-Moving Pet that I read on a lark, and for my trouble got&#8230; a Grey mushroom patch. <img src="./wiki/classic/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, I haven't seen one of those since that Downs dungeon.  No way it'll survive here." 
</p>
<p>
You're right; I should dismiss it out of kindness.  Anyway, let's move on: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>TDG 63</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a good feeling&#8230;"  Again, right into the middle of a huge swarm of monsters:  White wolves, Manes (Maneses?), Light hounds&#8230; and a Grand master mystic.  Better Recall-swap next to him and take him out first. 
</p>
<p>
Uh&#8230; what the @#$%?  I'm knocked out&#8230; o-<em>kaaay</em>, I'll never disrespect a Grand master mystic again. &#8216;S what I get for playing while tired, I suppose.  Ah well, I wanted to upgrade to 2.2.7 anyway&#8230; <img src="./wiki/classic/img/frown.png" alt="<:(" height="15" width="15">
