Alone in the wood lies a fire-blackened tree. Once an Ent, it is now a tall, silent, brooding presence. <em>Burarum</em> had played with it, carving their foul names in its surface and scorching its surface with torches. Yet where other Ents would have risen and crushed the foul <em>Burarum</em> tormenting it, this one stayed as would one asleep. But asleep it was not, instead sunk in a depth of despair. The Entwives were gone, the Entwives were gone. All the indignities it had suffered were as nothing to the pounding pulse of its despair. The Entwives were gone, the Entwives were gone... <p>
And so it might have remained, through the ages, until time and lightning had caused it to come crashing down. Instead, a tall, whispering figure had come along. It had a name the Ent did not know, but his type had a name the Ent knew well. Nazgul. It approached his trunk, icy fingers caressing the whorled surface, and for the first time in a century, the Ent felt emotion. Fear entered his soul, and with the fear came a darkness, a dischord. He quailed before it, and the Nazgul retreated a few paces. Then, with a windy cry, it reached back and plunged an Axe into the body of the Ent. Filled with rage, the Ent tore his roots from the ground and swung his branches, knocking the Nazgul aside. Reaching for the axe's handle, he ripped it from his body, wet with his own sap. He brandished it before the Nazgul 
</p>
<p>
Unhurt by the violence, the Nazgul laughed "You serve MY master now." he whispered, and fled.  
</p>
<p>

<p>
Blackwood Deadtree, the Ent Axemaster. Yes, contradictory enough, let alone the fact that he's worshipping Melkor. I plan to turn him into a Symbiant, as what would be more terrifying than a homicidal axe-wielding Ent with mossy limbs... <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
We pick up our story after the initial barrow-downs dive. Still basically have my starting kit, with the only semi-interesting drop being a Princess Quest reward metal cap of seeing. Since you can still get Green Glutton Ghost Lost Sword Quests in the Barrow-Downs, I'm very grateful.  
</p>
<p>
"Brrum, human. When can we get back to killing? <em>Burarum</em> are breathing while we tarry." 
</p>
<p>
Patience, my woody friend. We'll go down now.  
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDW 1</strong> - This level can't be all bad.  
</p>
<p>
&lt;yawn&gt; 
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDW 2</strong> - This level can't be all bad. 
</p>
<p>
&lt;yawn&gt; x 2 
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDW 3</strong> - You have an Excellent Feeling! (Princess - 10 Phantom Warriors) 
</p>
<p>
Hmph. Not much of a challenge.  
</p>
<p>
"Hoom!" 
</p>
<p>
Indeed. And so it proves. Stupidly, I let them surround me (not hard to be stupid when you're as slow as I am), and they do some damage. But soon they're dispersed to whatever lightless void gave them being, and a God Quest to boot. Will leave that until fire resist is covered, though.  
</p>
<p>
Paper Armour / Battle Axe / Light Crossbow. Excellent, an Axe for... Drat! Forgot it's a pole-arm. Oh well.  
</p>
<p>
Onwards to  
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDW 4</strong> - You feel strangely lucky (Princess - 11 Green Jellies) 
</p>
<p>
Hmmm... the Boomerang of Slay Animal I grabbed earier should be handy here, as with my speed they'll make mincemeat of my armour if I get in between them. Before all that though, Smeagol turns up... 
</p>
<p>
"Have you seens it, Treeman, have you SEENS it? We wants it back!" 
</p>
<p>
"Hoo! You look like <em>burarum</em> to me. Come here!" 
</p>
<p>
I get a couple of hits in before he pickpockets (not getting anything) and vanishes.  
</p>
<p>
"Hoom. I want to count his rings 'ere long."  
</p>
<p>
Do our best. But we might need a better weapon than this hatchet. We come upon the princess room which is full of lava, which is a bugger. But I'll set our speed to running, and try to get across before we get crisped. Which works out nicely. We finish them off, with only my cloak corroded away. A cleaver, a short-bow and a trident. Well the cleaver is an axe, so...  
</p>
<p>
We also gain a level, so I raise Axemastery and Prayer, and store the rest for FF's imminent granting of Symbiosis. It'll happen soon, I swear! <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15"> I'm a bit torn as to whether I should go for Boulder Throwing or Archery, but I'll hold back until I decide, as ranged is not as important as Melee as yet. Piety is still at an Eru-be-cursed low level, but it's early days.  
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDW 5</strong> - You like the look of this place. (FF - 17 Novice Mages) 
</p>
<p>
Yet to face any real challenges. I carve my way through them, and Bullroarer for good measure.  
</p>
<p>
"Hoo. Looks much like that thing we saw earier. This one has no rings though." 
</p>
<p>
Um. That half of Bullroarer is bleeding on you a bit as you're holding it up, Blackwood.  
</p>
<p>
"Blood and Bone, human, blood and bone." 
</p>
<p>
We clean up the Novice mages and FF offers us Thaum, Archery, Antimagic and Magic Device. I plump for archery.  
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDW 6</strong> - You feel your luck is turning... (FF - 9 Owlbears) 
</p>
<p>
"Root and twig, Bears I know, some Owls were hasty enough to make their nests in my body, but what are these?" 
</p>
<p>
Not something that you want nesting in your noggin, mate. Shall we?  
</p>
<p>
The first Owlbear comes included with some novice rogues, and pumps us to  
</p>
<p>
<strong>Level 11</strong> - Disarming, Prayer and Axemastery gain the benefits. Axemastery is up to 15.700, with Prayer at 9.000. Still have to make the decision re: Archery/Boulder throwing, but it can wait.  
</p>
<p>
Some Novice Priests relieve the piety situation, but it's still pretty dire. I'm not running out and buying curse just yet. A scroll of identify reveals a Ring of Levitation in the inventory, which I don. Eating through Owlbears (I wish that were a metaphor!) we gain a level.  
</p>
<p>
<strong>Level 12</strong> - Axemastery, Disarming, Magic Device and Prayer.  
</p>
<p>
"Hoom, Melkor isn't being hasty with benefiting me with Piety, human."  
</p>
<p>
Look on the bright side, when he does, Fire Immunity is on the cards! 
</p>
<p>
"Hoo!"  
</p>
<p>
FF is being at his most frustrating. He offers Summoning, Weaponmastery, Disarming and Divination. I choose Disarming, as it'll free up some skillpoints. As I do, in the distance we hear some muttering.  
</p>
<p>
"He has it, he mussst have it. Why else would he be following me but to tease poor Smeagol that he has it. Smeagol musts have it. He musts get it!" 
</p>
<p>
Smeagol gets it all right. in the neck. He drops a ring (Hmm... I wonder what THAT could be) and a Longbow (x4). Pack is as full as a goog, so we recall with the loot.  
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Time to go to Gondolin, Blackwood. Many Ent-Strides away, but I think we're getting to the stage where mass-identify is essential. We stride across Arda and reach the great city of Gondor. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gondolin</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"Hoom, these trees look like they're covered in stone." 
</p>
<p>
Not trees, Blackwood, towers made by men.  
</p>
<p>
"Brm...an odd lot, these humans. I can see why my Master Melkor wishes rid of them."  
</p>
<p>
The longbow is predictably of might, so I ditch the boomerang. Frustratingly, there are no arrows in Gondolin, though I've got 24 in my pack. they'll have to do. The Cleaver proves to be of Slay Orc, which pleases Blackwood immensely.  
</p>
<p>
"Hoom, I will strip the bark from their branches with this and let the borers do as they will."  
</p>
<p>
Urk. Wel we restock and rearm. I get some Phase Door scrolls, as Blackwood's not exactly built for speed.  
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDW 6</strong> - You feel your luck is turning... 
</p>
<p>
Turning to... 
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDW 7</strong> - You have a superb feeling about this level. (Princess - 11 Air Spirits) 
</p>
<p>
Told you that cap of seeing would prove handy. Some Snotlings provide cheap revenge.  
</p>
<p>
"<em>Burarum</em>, see this here? This is where your brother carved his name. Look at your friend's face. That's where I'm going to carve mine!" 
</p>
<p>
The Air spirits are a doddle, although they're in a lava princess quest room. Padded Armour, a morning star or a light crossbow? Hmmm... I'm sorted for ranged and have no use for a morning star, so I grab the Padded Armour, in the hope that it's elvenkind. Resist Acid. Oh well. It fills a hole.  
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDW 8</strong> - You have a very good feeling (Princess - 11 Moaning Spirits) 
</p>
<p>
Told you that cap of seeing would prove handy.  
</p>
<p>
"Hoom... Spirits flitting about. Most hasty." 
</p>
<p>
Also hasty are more Snotlings. Hastily departing, that is. I ID some old amulets and rings and come across... An Amulet of Reflection! Whack-o!  
</p>
<p>
Moaning Spirits start coming through the walls (A Ghostbusters double feature is on tonight on the TV, BTW ;-)) and push me to... 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Level 14</strong> - Axemastery, Prayer and Magic Device draw the honours. 
</p>
<p>
Working my way around to the room, I find it's ANOTHER &amp;*%*&amp; lava room (<a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a>, is that version of swearing OK?). The final Moaning Spirit moans about being the last one left alive (er... undead) and departs, leaving me with a choice of a Longsword, a shortsword or some soft leather boots. Wondering how they're going to fit, we squeeze them onto a dangling root and find ourselves floating a little bit easier.  
</p>
<p>
"Brm... we don't need this silly little metal ring now, do we?" 
</p>
<p>
No, we don't. But I dno't want invisibility just yet, so we keep it on so it doesn't foul up our inventory. Down to... 
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDW 9</strong> - You feel strangely lucky... (Princess - 5 Light Hounds) 
</p>
<p>
"Hoom, human, they should eat more." 
</p>
<p>
Who should? 
</p>
<p>
"If they're light hounds, then they should eat more. That will fatten them up..." 
</p>
<p>
&lt;groan&gt; 
</p>
<p>
A horde of Kobolds (led by Mughash) provide un-Comic relief. An unwise potion tasting takes our strength down, as well as reducing our attacks from three to two. The Light Hounds provide some welcome photosynthesis, but no real challenge. We're offered a small metal shield, a dagger and a flail. The Cleaver is only a one-handed weapon, so I go the shield. Resist lightning. Oh well, another hole filled. One of the lighthounds pushed us through to  
</p>
<p>
<strong>Level 15</strong> - Axemastery, Prayer and one each to Disarming and Magic Device.  
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDW 10</strong> - You have a good feeling... (FF - 15 Killer Brown beetles) 
</p>
<p>
"Brm... I have no liking for Beetles. They try to drink my sap!" 
</p>
<p>
We wander round, and Wormtongue pops out and ineffectually hammers at us. We watch at him hacking away at our branches and swing our cleaver. His drop is excellent, with a Hard Studden Leather of Elvenkind and a Boomerang (Defender), I wield both, even not *Identified*. I'll miss the extra might bow, but the resists are more important.  
</p>
<p>
Another unwuse quaffing takes down our Dex, but we're close to the end, so might as well just suck it up and continue. With pleasure, Blackwood notices that the Elvenkind gives him <em>burarum</em> ESP. A ring of Fire Resist also gives us something to turf the Levitation ring for.  
</p>
<p>
A mass of blue dragon worms give us some serious trouble, so serious that we have to dip into the trees.  
</p>
<p>
We wander round inside the trees for a while, picking off Brown beetles, when I notice we're actually level SEVENTEEN. 
</p>
<p>
My, time flies when you're killing <em>burarum</em>.  
</p>
<p>
I raise Axemastery and Prayer. This leaves 11 skill points burning a hole in my pocket, but I might as well save-em up.  
</p>
<p>
Before I know it, Level EIGHTEEN has arrived. I do the same again. The final BB finally falls, but FF is again unkind, offering Summoning, Mindcraft, Conveyance and Barehand Combat. I go for mindcraft, although I'd been hoping to stay in-theme with this character. I recall, and that's the Barrowdowns done and dusted.  
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gondolin</strong>  
</p>
<p>
Nothing proves to be of any interest in my inventory, But *ID*ing the Armour and Boomerang proves fun. I've now got a big slew of resists and see invis and Free Actions. I think this lot will last me a while <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":-)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
Big decision, do we wander round Mirkwood waiting for Fumblefingers or do we lit out for the Orc Caves, as Blackwood seems to want to do.  
</p>
<p>
"Lord Melkor would surely prefer it if I destroyed as many of his unworthy servants, hoom, as quickly as possible." 
</p>
<p>
Yes, but think of the moss! The MOSS! 
</p>
<p>
"Human, you never take the proper time to make decisions. Oh well... if we must. Hmmrr..." 
</p>
<p>
So we do, and then just as quickly (being flat, stony broke) go to Mirkwood.  
</p>
<p>
<strong>MKW 11</strong> - You have a very good feeling (Princess - 11 Flesh Golems) 
</p>
<p>
Mirkwood is great for Ents, as there's nothing but trees, which means that it's an open road for Ents, while most of the others are constrained by the trees. Ho ho ho.  
</p>
<p>
The Flesh golems are rooming with Brodda, the Easterling.  
</p>
<p>
"Ah, human, have you seen the entwives in the east?"  
</p>
<p>
"&lt;deleted crude comment about the entwives&gt;" 
</p>
<p>
"HOOM!" 
</p>
<p>
We're offered a dagger, a battle axe (no, I'm not making THAT mistake again) and a short sword. I go the dagger for weight reasons. As I didn't have the cash to stock up on Identify scrolls, I'll have to be selective about my pickup choices.  
</p>
<p>
<strong>MKW 12</strong> You  have a good feeling (Princess  - 14 Tarantulas) 
</p>
<p>
Indeed I do, as it's an arena level.  
</p>
<p>
"Brm. Not many trees here. Lord Melkor has been busy."  
</p>
<p>
Good for us, though. Means we can zip about. Nothing of interest. The Tarantulas are fast, but with RPoison we've got no fear. They fall easily, and offer us a Hard Leather Cap, a sling and a morning star. I grab the cap, as it may be Thurandil.  
</p>
<p>
I've also gained a level. Axemastery, disarming, prayer and magic device get "the treatment". 
</p>
<p>
<strong>MKW 13</strong> You feel strangely lucky. (Princess - Gorbag, the Orc Captain) 
</p>
<p>
"HOOM! BRU-BARUM BRUM! HOO! HOOM! <strong>HOOM!</strong>" 
</p>
<p>
M'dear fella, what's the problem? 
</p>
<p>
All Blackwood does is point to a section of his thigh. On it is chipped <em>"Gorbag wuz ere. Shagrat iz a yeek!"</em> 
</p>
<p>
Enough said. We find Gorbag, who denies everything.  
</p>
<p>
"It's not even my handwriting, you stupid Ent." he says, quickly hiding his chisel,  "I'll take a polygraph..." 
</p>
<p>
And it's on. And Gorbag is off almost as quickly. Bye bye. Now let's... what're you doing, Blackwood? 
</p>
<p>
"Hoom... where's that chisel? I want to make sure they know that 'Blackwood wuz ere'". 
</p>
<p>
&lt;sigh&gt; Her royal ex-capturedness offers a choice of two polearms and a morningstar. My, how useless are we today? (Also level up... Axemastery, Prayer and Magic Device) We grab the morning star, but we're full up anyway, so we recall and begin the long trek back to... 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
We ID, and there are a few nice goodies, including a morning star of Aman and a Hard Leather Cap of regeneration. I'm tempted by the Regen, but the metal cap of seeing includes +5 to searching and (I think) resist blindness. Oh well. A rod tip of illumination tempts me in the Black market, but I chicken out and buy it.  
</p>
<p>
<strong>MKW 13</strong> - You have a superb feeling about this level... 
</p>
<p>
We decide to poke around, and... well, well, well a mini-vault. A pair of Algroths, an evil eye, a cold vortex and a black louse. One of the more pathetic vaults, I think you'll agree. I go to get in, and... oh bugger. No door, and I haven't got a digger. Nothing for it.  
</p>
<p>
"Hoo! Nothing for what, human."  
</p>
<p>
Ever wanted to be like Dennis Lillee? Or Steve Young? You know, throwing things really fast!  
</p>
<p>
We spend two skill points on boulder throwing, and get into the vault. The Gauth proves a pain in the proverbial, and disenchants the Metal cap and the boomerang, as well as healing himself by my mana a few times. The rest fall easily, but the lice escape into the trees and start breeding.  
</p>
<p>
I ignore them and clear the floor. Nothing interesting, though the ego-items are nice. OK, superb taken care of, down to...  
</p>
<p>
Up to Level 21, Axemastery and prayer. I won't bother upping boulder throwing as it's effectively useless in Mirkwood, where there are no walls to make boulders from.  
</p>
<p>
<strong>MKW 14</strong> You feel your luck is turning (Princess - Sangahyando of Umbar) 
</p>
<p>
"Hoom, when will that absent minded adventurer return. We're here to learn how to make moss play across my skin." 
</p>
<p>
I don't know. The RNG knows my every move before I make it, and frustrates me every time! 
</p>
<p>
Sangahyando actually gets me down to the level where I have to Phase Door away. The first monster to make me do that! We hide in the trees, and then rush back, chopping him off at the knees. The Cleaver of Slay orc isn't really cutting it anymore, so isn't it nice that the Princess is offering me another? <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":-)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
Spectral Cleaver of Slay Evil. Hmmmm... handy, but the HP drain is a pain. I can't try it, as my current cleaver has picked up a curse. Will make a judgement when I go back to Loth. 
</p>
<p>
(amusing, my Level title makes me out to be an Ent Axemaster Swordsman) 
</p>
<p>
<strong>MKW 15</strong> You have a very good feeling (Princess - 6 Ice Skeletons) 
</p>
<p>
Pretty good. Outside the quest room, a large wooden chest drops a STR potion, my first stat gain! Yay!. The Ice Skeletons fall quicker than an arrow flies. Lead-Filled Mace, Hard Studded Leather, Guisame. I go the hard studded. Hmm... a randart. Will check it out when I have *ID* at my fingertips.  
</p>
<p>
Down we go to... 
</p>
<p>
<strong>MKW 16</strong> - You have a good feeling (Princess - 12 Earth Hounds) 
</p>
<p>
Hmmm... we'll need to be careful here. We can't get into a hit-and-run battle. Shards HURT! We dodge and weave and manage to crush them. I notice Blackwood prodding them with his foot.  
</p>
<p>
They are dead, mate.  
</p>
<p>
"Brm... just seeing if they'd be good to setle down in when this is all over. A nice bit of loose crumbly soil would really be nice about now..." 
</p>
<p>
&lt;shudder&gt; 
</p>
<p>
Large Leather Shield, Guisame and Glaive. go the LLS. Resist fire, which isn't a whole heap of help. Will do one more level and recall.  
</p>
<p>
<strong>MKW 17</strong> You feel strangely lucky (Princess: Ibun, son of Mim) 
</p>
<p>
This will likely be a pain, I fear. Tough, self-healing and fire-bolt throwing. I get to him (though a crowd of neekerbreekers and some killer bees that drain my STR) and my fears are confirmed. And he disenchants! This is not good. I suck it up and keep whalin' on him. The firebolts bounce off (Melkor BLESS you, Amulet of Reflection). My equipment takes some hits, but not nearly as many as I'd feared. He gets me down a bit over half, but that's WELL within safety margins. Bye Ibun. Send my regards to your daddy! 
</p>
<p>
Get a choice of a 3-piece rod, Metal scale mail and a Lead-Filled Mace, I go the scale male, despite the fact it'll take a lot to get me to give up my hard-leather armour. I recall to... 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lothlorien</strong> 
</p>
<p>
The Metal Scale mail is of resistance, and the randart is a candidate for "Worst Randart... ever!" Sustain strength, resist acid and NOTHING else. Sheesh! 
</p>
<p>
The HP drain on the spectral cleaver appears to be keeping pace with my regen, so I switch to it, and sell the Slay Orc. Nothing else is of interest, so I restock and return...  
</p>
<p>
<strong>MKW 17</strong> You have a good feeling... 
</p>
<p>
That draws me to...  
</p>
<p>
<strong>MKW 17</strong> You have a very good feeling... (Princess - Mim, Betrayer of Turin) 
</p>
<p>
Oh... his son was only one floor up. Mirkwood is obviously part of the family concern...  
</p>
<p>
An air hound takes me up a level, and Axemaster, Magic Device and Prayer are the benficiaries. I've got to devote some effort to piety raising soon. First, I have to survive Mim.  
</p>
<p>
"My son, you monster! No one kills family members but ME? Get it? Capice?" 
</p>
<p>
I scratch away at him, which is unfortuantely about as much progress as I make, and am forced to Phase Door away. Then I smack my forehead. The benefits of a spectral weapon is spectral form. I go back, but it's no use, he's too fast and strong for me. I need a ranged attack to soften him up, as well as some speed. Reluctantly, I recall. The spectral weapon is a bust in the sense that the HP drain prevents regeneration, making me less capable of sustained combat. 
</p>
<p>
I decide to give it one more try... re-enchanting my cleaver and stocking up on pots of heroism and scrolls of blessing, ANYTHING that will give me an edge... 
</p>
<p>
<strong>MKW 17</strong> You have a very good feeling... (Princess - Mim, Betrayer of Turin) 
</p>
<p>
Find him, quaff a pot, read a scroll, activate a spectrality. Yesss... with the tohit bonuses in action, I get him down before I have to Phase Door away, and after a few quick CCWs, I get him to where he flees! Hah, the shoe's on the other root now, eh Blackwood? 
</p>
<p>
"Hoom... I think this stand of trees is about to be felled..." 
</p>
<p>
Woo hoo! Gone! 
</p>
<p>
Thunderlord coat, mousefur or ringmail... I'll go the mousefur... A mousful of immolation... 
</p>
<p>
"Hoo! It burns, human, it burns!" 
</p>
<p>
Yesyes, but you're not. Calm down. We sort through the loot. Not much of interest, so we decamp to... 
</p>
<p>
<strong>MKW 18</strong> You have a superb feeling about this level... (FF - 17 Energy Vortices) 
</p>
<p>
Should be a doddle, but I'm worried about the superb. Start chewin' through the vortices em, and go up a level. Axemastery, Magic device and prayer. 
</p>
<p>
FF offers me... awwwwrrrghh! No Symbiosis despite four offers! Weaponmastery, conveyance, Divination and Spirituality. Oh well... all for the saving throw... Spirituality. Still confused by the Superb so hunt around... a Jelly pit. Just my luck!  
</p>
<p>
<strong>MKW 19</strong> You feel strangely lucky... (Princess - 5 Dark Elven Druds) 
</p>
<p>
And right pains they turn out to be, too. Fast summoners. But I eventually wade through them, and am offered a Lead Filled Mace, a Beaked Axe and a small sword. I know the Beaked Axe is a Polearm, but what the hey! And wouldn't you know, the Beaked Axe of Hurin...  
</p>
<p>
<strong>MKW 20</strong> You feel strangely lucky... (Princess - 5 White Wraiths) 
</p>
<p>
Some air hounds take me up to 25. Spread blows will be a great ability considering my speed! The Wraiths fall easily and I am offered: Metal scale mail (x2) and a pike. Go the MSM (II) 
</p>
<p>
Ahah! An ELVEN metal scale mail. Hopefully it'll be as good as my current one.  
</p>
<p>
<strong>MKW 21</strong> You have a good feeling... (Princess - Khufu the Mummified King) 
</p>
<p>
Trolls drop a Battle Axe Randart. (Yes, I know it's a polearm, yes, I know it's a polearm!) 
</p>
<p>
As with Mim, I go the full heroism + blessing for his undeadness. He summons some zombies, but they avail him not! A pike, Rhino-Hide armour and a sabre are the options, and I go for the armour.  
</p>
<p>
<strong>MKW 22</strong> Huh?  
</p>
<p>
Hmm... seem to have lost my notes for what happened here.  
</p>
<p>
"Hoom, human your memories depart so hastily, it's a wonder you can remember where you were a sapling!" 
</p>
<p>
That's enough outta you! 
</p>
<p>
I recall to Loth for the full ID. Nothing amazing, so I restock, rearm and...  
</p>
<p>
<strong>MKW 22</strong> You have a good feeling.  
</p>
<p>
Ufthak of Cirith Ungol (and horde) provide a moment's amusement, and Blackwood says nothing about graffiti artists,, so hopefully he's got it off his chest! 
</p>
<p>
A bit of loot, but nothging that catches the eye, so down to...  
</p>
<p>
<strong>MKW 23</strong> You have a superb feeling (Princess - 14 Mages)  
</p>
<p>
Some Elite Uruks provide a small part of that, along with Ugluk. Lots of high-level Orcs around.  
</p>
<p>
"Brm... this forest needs some selected felling."  
</p>
<p>
The mages prove a pushover, and as an added bonus, I'm into positive piety. (though not yet at the autocurse level). I'm offered a 3-piece-rod, a Light crossbow and a Glaive. I go the Xbow, and it proves to be of accuracy. Oh well, one for the money...  
</p>
<p>
<strong>MKW 24</strong> You feel strangely lucky... (Princess 12 Displacer Beasts) 
</p>
<p>
"Pussy cats. DOZENS of pussy cats." 
</p>
<p>
No, only a dozen, you tend to see double with this mob. Funnily enough, their corpses only appear in single file. We're offered a mage-staff, Double Ring mail or an Orcish Pick. I go the pick, for the sake of completeness more than anything else. It's of digging, and I wield it, just for a place to put it.  
</p>
<p>
<strong>MKW 25</strong> You have a very good feeling (Princess - Lokkak, the Ogre Chieftain).  
</p>
<p>
"Hoom, he will be as tough as teak."  
</p>
<p>
Oooh yeah. Not sure whether we can take him, but we'll give him a go, with bless and heroism. (though since I'm a Melkor Warrior, it's more of ANTI-heroism)... I start on him, and OUCH, he hits hard. He gets me down to a hundred HP, and I decide to phase door out of... uh oh... uh... Blackwood, what happened to those scrolls we had?  
</p>
<p>
"Those little flat bits of old tree? I'm not sure. Did we need them?"  
</p>
<p>
OUCH... and... we're away... 
</p>
<p>
In retrospect, the lack of a missile attack, and my boneheaded pursuit of symbiosis were what doomed this character, however, it gave me a better idea of how to play Ents, and of the fact that PURE warriors tend to be easy meat with lots of spare skill points hanging around...
