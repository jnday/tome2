<p>
This is a continuation of a thread in the strategy section. It's a (semi) blow by blow account of how I got a monk character going. It will not be of interest to everyone. If you think you'll be bored by this thread, then don't bother reading it 
</p>
<p>
By all means, please post with your questions/comments. I doubt I can answer them all, but hopefully someone else can. 
</p>
<p>
A few caveats: - I've never played a monk before, so you'll probably see beginner's mistakes. I've never won a game, either. - Nasty critiquers will be invited to type up their OWN day in a life - Starting out, I will put in a lot of detail, but later on it's going to get trimmed down. If there's any specific detail you want that you don't see, please say so. 
</p>
<p>
That being said, I hope you enjoy. Slappy, the Abbess of Pain, has gotten to CL10. For convenience, I'll post a link to her oook dump here. And hopefully, the fact of my posting her before CL20 will not result in YASD any time soon. 
</p>
<h3 id="head-b87ccb91a6bac254f1d6ab5e6736cc228da5e3d3">Day in a life #1: Rolling up a character</h3>
<p>
The first thing I did was NOT to roll up a character. 
</p>

    <ol type="1">

    <li>
<p>
I pulled up the online help and I read. Remember, I've never played a monk before! I don't go so far as planning every last skill point as some do. I'd probably be better off if I did but I don't have the patience. Still, I try to make informed decisions. 
</p>
</li>

    </ol>


<p>
Monk stat bonuses. Hmmm, +1 to STR, WIS &amp; DEX, -2 int, no change to CON. They get 1.000 in monster lore and in corpse preservation, but 0.000 in possession and music. Hrmmmm. (Music? Possession? Do I want those?) 
</p>
<p>
The main things to pump are barehand combat, combat itself, and dodging. As skill level goes up, you get speed and increased blows. Big penalty for carrying weapons/armor at higher levels. Fine. The monk barehand blows seem to be affected only by character level, not STR or DEX, how odd... 
</p>
<p>
Mental shortlist: I want Speed, STR, Stealth, and infravision. INT and/or WIS for spell casting would be nice too, and DEX always helps. At high levels I will probably not be wearing any armor or weapon, so all the intrinsics I can get are desireable. I need levitate (or flying), ID/mapping, trap management, healing, and some sort of ranged attack. And all four immunities , while I'm wishing! 
</p>
<p>
Monks get access to spells in the Meta, Temporal, &amp; Mind schools of magic. I go read about those. Meta--eh. Recharge isn't worth 10 skill points. Mind--hrm, a possibility. I don't think I'd take it past Armor of Fear if I did. Hm, Fire Golem, never used that before, mental note: search forum on that, is it useful? Temporal -- Ah-hah. Now this could be good. Magelock turns at L30 to glyph of warding. Don't know if I want to go that high, but worth noting. Slow monsters turns into a zone spell at L20. Essense of speed at L15. And grow trees at 6. That's a keeper - to L15, anyway. 
</p>
<p>
Gods. Hmm. I usually play Eru characters, but I don't think that'll work here. I want speed, so I'll probably try Manwe for the first time ever. Doublechecking the gods spoiler shows Manwe gives levitate, FA and flying (great!) and he likes elves. Well, I like elves too, so that works. Manwe's spells -- they look good for a monk. Manwe also gives access to the Air and Conveyance schools. Air--eh. Conveyance gives a few good spells but probably more skill points than I want to spend there. 
</p>
<p>
Add to mental short list: See if I can't get spells from the Divination School somehow. Hear that, FF??? 
</p>

    <ul>

 #2 Now I go have a look at oook to see what other folks have done with monks. This turns out to be somewhat less helpful than it might be, since many of the monk posts date back to older versions of ToME. Still, I gather a few points:     <li class="gap">
<p>
 Popular skills (other than barehand and dodging) for pumping include mindcraft, thaumaturgy and magic. Mindcraft makes sense - if you take it to 23, you get added speed &amp; healing via Adrenaline Channeling, and ID at 40. Thaumatury is very powerful at high levels, but also unpredictable, and I don't want to blow the skill points to get up there. OTOH, if that's the best thing FF offers, I'll take it! 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Monk possessors, mostly wearing dragons. This makes sense too (extra ring slots, etc, which don't penalize monks.) Possession doesn't sound very monkish to me, but I might try it later, we'll see. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Lostsoul monks (usually combined with possessors.) A good way of getting great rings early... *IF* you survive! 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Short list for races after skimming birth.txt: Dark elf, dunadan (no infra), elf, gnome, high elf, half elf, hobbit, wood elf. Oook shows a number of <a class="nonexistent" href="./RohanKnight">RohanKnight</a> &amp; Deathmold monks, but I'm not interested in either of those. Deathmolds are weird, and RKs have rotten stealth. I suppose a monk doesn't have to be stealthy, but I'll take any advantage I can get. 
</p>
<p>
In the end, I pick a Wood Elf. Why? I love wood elves. They get intrinisic tree walking, which is a great way of keeping a low level character alive. AFAIK (please correct me) you can get tree walking in one of three ways: Being a Wood Elf, being an Ent, and worshipping Yavanna in order to buy it. 
</p>
<p>
Race modifiers: Ooooh, vampires! That would be perfect. Except... it's not a birth option. Rats. Lostsoul is tempting, but I've got another one right now. Classical it is. 
</p>
<p>
So, I'll run a Classical Wood Elf Monk. Second choice would be a <a href="./LostSoul">LostSoul</a> Hobbit Monk/Possessor. 
</p>

    <ul>

 #3 Checking the skills spoiler shows I certainly do want to boost Combat as well as Barehand Combat. Involved rule for going without armor. Mental note to check the spoiler again when CL15-20 or so. 
    </ul>


<p>
Abilities: Treewalking is intrinsic. Of the rest, I don't know yet if extra blows apply to monks. (Do they?) If so, then YES. Of the others, only 'make ammo' appeals, and I can live without that. 
</p>
<p>
Summary: Wood-Elf Monk, Manwe, looking for Divination &amp; Symbiosis, keeping in mind Temporal and maybe Mind or Mindcraft. Or even Thaumaturgy. Music?? We'll see what FF brings. 
</p>

    <ul>

 #4 Rollup (finally!) 
    </ul>


<p>
I pick a female classical wood elf monk. Worshipping Manwe. 98 quests. Stupid monsters (OK, I'm a wimp), no arenas. I set the autoroller to SIWDCC = 15 15 15 18 11 --. Three rolls later, I have a character with decent stats (for an elf) and social class 81, which means 428 AU on startup. 
</p>
<p>
Thus is born Slappy, Abbess of Pain. Whether it be her pain or that of her opponents is yet to be determined. 
</p>
<p>
Next installment: CL1 - CL10. 
</p>
<h4 id="head-9c3befe7e22c8667bc957541f49b0ee79970b588">Notes:</h4>
<p>
I'd write this from the perspective of the character, but it'd make it even wordier. 
</p>
<p>
From now on until I say otherwise, whenever I kill townspeople or other critters, I take the corpse if there is one, hack it up and sell it. Edit: This relates only to town/surface level. The only time I drag a corpse up from the dungeon is for a Beastmaster quest. 
</p>
<p>
Starting AU = 428 
</p>
<p>
I level up in the swamp south of Bree. Others prefer the hills. I usually level up faster than this, but I'm not familiar with the Monk class. 
</p>
<h3 id="head-0e7070081dee6288db48afffa2ea4475b219cbbd">Day in a life #2: CL1 - CL10 (Levelling up)</h3>
<h4 id="head-565fb6b15c81b7e4e01cccd7ca5405ae582ba6e3">CL1:</h4>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Wielded the armor given me. Acquired Maggot quest. Killed an idiot, got an essence to sell (wheehaw.) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Bought a sling and 20 iron shots. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 General store has lanterns but no oils, so I buy neither. Also no shovels! And no cloaks. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Bought metal cap - same AC as boots but lighter. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Changed my mind and bought the boots after all. Turns out they disrupt my balance, so I sold them back. Even a pair of gloves disrupts, so I'm stuck with AC 9. Ugh. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Killed another idiot. Between dropped AU &amp; rag &amp; meats sold, I'm back to 479 AU. I buy 1 scroll of teleport and 5 potions of CLW. (There aren't any better cure potions available, worse luck. Dang these shops rot!) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I head to the swamp area south of Bree. Treewalking makes it easy, as I can enter and exit the swamp map anywhere except a small area in the top lefthand corner of the map where there's mountains. Lurking along, I creep up on a Green Naga dozing near the map edge and lob some iron shots at it. Unfortunately, a Crebain shows up. Knowing they often run in groups (and the Crebain is coming over the edge of a panel, so I can't tell if it's a singleton or not) and the Naga has smacked me for a bunch of HP, I dive back into the trees. Three iron shots lost. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 First kill, with the sling: A Giant Green Frog. Wandered, spied a clump o' Lizard Men and ran away. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Revenge: I find another Green Naga, this time with no Crebain around. It takes 8 hits from my sling (I don't dare hand-to-hand it yet) but I kill it and.... 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<h4 id="head-eea107c82a8b7e88b2a5458a5a93356aacce55f7">CL5:</h4>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Grabbed all 8 iron shots, ran off the map into the trees and healed up. Dumped 9 skill points into Barehand (the maximum) and 5 into Dodging. Held onto the rest. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Spied a lone Lizard Man. Thought about it greedily - I'm VERY close to CL6. Then thought about it twice, and moved on. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 More revenge: Killed a lone Crebain.... 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<h4 id="head-20d3b2c0cae89379507d09fbd148152976c580b4">CL6:</h4>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 2 skill points (max) into barehand, 2 into dodging; hold the rest. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Made a very foolish and abortive attempt at a 3-Headed Hydra. Blew most of my ammo at it and ended up afraid &amp; running for my life. Barely made it. Headed back to town to buy more iron shots. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Back to the swamp: Nearly tripped over a Green Naga. Killed it... 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<h4 id="head-d3ea2620358d70d817940784dba20a323dea93d1">CL7:</h4>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 2 skill points (max) into barehand, 2 into dodging; hold the rest. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Sold Naga meats for a tidy 260 AU, bringing me to 570 AU. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Went on a minor tirade after townspeople. Starting to use barehand combat now as well as the sling. Between booty, gold &amp; meats: 811 AU. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Bought Wand of Manathrust. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Thought about doing the Bree House Quest. Decided I really want to kill a Hydra first. No particular reason for that. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Swamp: Killed another Crebain. Discovered that 2-Headed Hydras could care *LESS* about 5d2 Manathrusts. Ugh. Barely escape with my life, and buy a stack more Iron Shots. Maybe we'll think twice about this Hydra obsession 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Killed a Pink Frog, a bunch of townspeople, and another Crebain... 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<h4 id="head-ec3ea621d8940936284dcbcdaf3993604f0f2c26">CL8:</h4>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 2 skill points (max) into barehand, 2 into dodging, 2 into magic device (think: wands); hold the rest. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Killed a Pink Frog, Green Naga, and a few Newts. This is getting boring. Ran into a 2-Headed Hydra, actually managed to damage it somewhat, but I don't have rfear, and the Iron Shots and wand can't compensate. Ran for my life. Again. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Went back to buy more Iron Shots and discovered the shops inventories have cycled. Now the general store has oil but no lanterns! Rggh. Bought 8 flasks of oil, I figure I can throw them at the very least. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 *Blinks* Hey, I've got +1 speed now!!! Yay! (But is it from Barehand or from Manwe? Must find out.) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 <strong>BREE HOUSE QUEST</strong> The house quest wasn't hard, once I remembered to set Exploration to 'running' (Doh!) I used a combination of barehand, iron shots and manathrust. Killed everything else and ended up chasing the Brigand around while it squealed like a baby (it had run away earlier) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Bought ID and sold the good dagger from the house quest. Sold the empty wand of Manathrust. Bought a pair of soft boots, which turn out not to encumber me, yay. Sold un-ID'd soft studded leather armor from the house quest and MUCH to my disgust, it turned out to be [5,+6]. I managed to steal it back, which started a minor crime spree. This character must be lucky, because I managed to score a nice cloak of stealth &amp; potions of cure insanity from the Black Market, along with scrolls of ID. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Back to the swamp. I know I could start the Barrow Downs now without a problem, but for some nebulous reason I've settled on CL10 to start there. Maybe it's those hydras calling. But mainly it's because I don't have a shovel yet, and Thou Shalt Not Go Underground Without A Digger. Killed a Newt and a Pink Frog.... 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<h4 id="head-62e2bf32b1b9bb11b373c52b3cde5d89b3c4f7f6">CL9:</h4>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 2 skill points (max) into barehand, 2 into dodging; hold the rest. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Killed a Pink and a Green Frog, a Crebain, sold meats. With the combined proceeds, I bought a Pick, 1 WOR scroll, 2 more Teleport scrolls for a total of 3. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I'm thinking about doing the Maggot quest before hitting the Barrow Downs. Given my leaning on the sling, it would probably be a good idea. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Back to the swamp. Again. I took on a Lizard King. Almost got him, too -- down to 4 stars -- but the rfear problem reared its head again. Thank goodness for treewalking, as I made an escape with 0 hitpoints. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 <strong>FARMER MAGGOT QUEST</strong> Decided I might as well. Coward/Running. Coward partly for the save throw and partly to help me from accidentally killing the dogs. Running gives me total speed of +5, which makes the quest easy. I duck in/out/around the dogs, up to overland travel and back down. Even when they're biting me I'm only down to something like 1/3 of my hitpoints, which is pretty amazing, so it must be more of this monk stuff kicking in. I head back to town with 54 mushrooms and duly collect my sling and healing shrooms. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Picked up the Merton quest. I'll do that later. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 My life of crime went bad: Failed to steal a potion of intelligence from the Black Market. Oh well. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Bought 2 WORs for 3 total. No enchant-to-dams available for the sling, or scrolls of satisfy hunger. Sold the pick for a shovel (it's lighter) and bought extra food. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Ducked into the Barrow Downs. L1 is a Princess quest for a bunch of Brown Yeeks. Shouldn't be a problem. However, I have an idea, and duck back out again. The idea is this: Very often when I get my first Beastmaster quest over in Lothlorien, it's for some monster which I have just recently killed in early Barrow Downs. So if I can get that quest first, maybe I can save myself some work? 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Went to Gondolin and got some Scrolls of Satisfy Hunger. Nothing else good there. Thought of going on to Lothlorien, and then decided not to. Too much chance of getting ambushed. So much for my bright idea. Came back to Bree, killed a Crebain, and.... 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>

<h4 id="head-70440046a3dc2e079f23ee1c57dfa76669b732aa">Notes</h4>
I'm wrapping this up late at night, *WAY* past my bedtime, so I apologize in advance for typos/formatting/wavering tenses and the like. I may add on later and will point it out if I do so, but I wanted to get this posted tonight. Er, this morning. - M. <p>
Oook dump is updated. 
</p>
<p>
OK, the Barrow Downs. Some people elect to start elsewhere, and all the more power to them. I always start in the Barrow Downs. Generally speaking, the quest rewards help quite a bit with starting kit (more on that in a moment) and I almost never get killed there. 
</p>
<p>
98 quests, so there's a Princess or Lost-Sword quest on every level. Two changes this time around. 
</p>
<p>
The first is just a general one for me. Used to be I'd explore every level completely, but now I'm going through as quickly as possible. (I'll probably slow down later on, but I'm still not going to try to scour the entire level each time.) 
</p>
<p>
The second is the Princess rewards. This character is a monk. I don't want weapons, so if the rewards are all weapons I'm going to pick whichever one I think is most likey to be an artifact so I can sell it. If it's armor, if it's something lightweight that I *might* be able to wear, like a cloak or a golden crown, *maybe* boots, I'll take that. If it's heavy armor, again, I'll look for an artifact to sell. 
</p>
<p>
For Fumblefingers, I'll just cross my own fingers. Seems to me FF is even more valuable to Monks than to most classes. 
</p>
<p>
I'm not going to write down every last thing she kills anymore -- it's no longer feasible -- but if anything unusual comes up I'll note it. I am going to track the princess offerings, though, just for grins, and what FF offers. I'll also note Piety, AU and other stats occasionally. 
</p>
<p>
Oh yes: I'm also tracking total # slime molds eaten, to see when/if she gets the mold-growing power. Total to date, at CL18, is 2. Don't know why I haven't found more, maybe it's just the fast diving. 
</p>
<h4 id="head-3d53d9943e133b905bbd84aeceb57f1d863c7b5e">continuing with CL10</h4>
Recap: When last we left Slappy, she had just shot a Crebain in the swamp south of Bree, and reached CL10. Once again I put 2 skill points each into Barehand and Dodging, and held the remaining skill points. <p>
In the midst of celebrating her achievement and ruminating on things to come, she purchased a copy of Manwe's Blessing and stored it at home for future use. Then she made an unhappy discovery. She'd been killing all those evil things in the swamp... and had not been praying to Manwe at the time! Doh! Much chagrined, she became a much better worshipper forthwith. (Thanks, khearn, for your post. She's an elf, so I'll leave her praying all the time.) 
</p>
<p>
Enchanted Maggot's sling up to +3 to-dam. And toted along 3 Mushrooms of Unhealth from Maggot's quest. I didn't write down whether I carried any ID scrolls but I'm sure I did. 
</p>

 Ran out of Iron Shots. Picked up some I found and wielded them, un-ID'd, and got bit - they were cursed. Thankfully, apparently they weren't anything dreadful like Backbiters, as I could actually still hit with them. Hm.

    <li>
<p>
 Um. This makes me a little nervous, but I'm not really worried. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Ran into/killed something invisible. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Argh, lice!!! I end up wading through a small mass of them and go running into the trees to get away. I hope the princess room is on the OTHER side of the map. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Speaking of which, I should mention that one of the first things I do when arriving on a DL is to toggle the map ('M' in original keyset) to see where in the map I arrived. This usually somewhat drives how I explore - I may double back to look in a map corner, for example, if I'm close to one.

 Trip a Poison Bolt Trap. This time I *don't* get better and CCW saves me.

 More lice!!! I burn my first Teleport Scroll, and land near the Princess room.

 I have a note here that I destroyed a soft armor out of hand. It was the first time I got rid of something I could potentially have sold. I didn't record the reason why, but I probably ID'd it and found it was 4,+0 and not worth hauling back.

</li>
    <li>

 Thankfully the bears are sectioned off by the Princess room. They are a little tougher, and I have to resort to CCW a few times and/or rest in between fights. Got my first "It was a good hit!" message.

</p>
</li>
    <li>

 Got 10 scrolls of ID, ID'd a few things and sold the rest. Nothing interesting. Bought 3 WOR, 2 more enchant to-dam for the sling (both fail), and restock CCW.

<p>
 Ditched the shrooms of unhealth in the house, I've encountered nothing scary yet. (Famous last words.)

 Got remove curse and unwielded those darn iron shots. Yes, I've been carrying them this whole time - I'd forgot about it! I guess that shows how often I'm using the silly tihngs. Sold them to the Armory, too, &amp; made them howl Bought 25 new shots to replace the old - maybe uncurse ones will work better? Ya think??

<p>
+4 to STR, INT, WIS, DEX, CHA, and Speed. Fires missiles excessively fast. Mind you, I've seen many better artifacts than this, but I'm sure not knocking this one! (Well, that CHA could be CON, darnit, but oh well ) Happy dance time again. I dump Maggot's sling in the house (I'll probably Mathom it) and ditch the shots. Turns out there are no arrows to be had in town, but I don't care.

    <li>
<p>
 I realize I'd forgotten to up skill points for CL13, so I add +2 each for Barehand and Dodging. 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
OK, not Bree, but I sat back and thought for a while. 
</p>
<p>
Where the heck is FF? And why haven't I seen any god quests? FF, I know, is just being a tease. I find myself wondering if I need to have skill points in prayer to get god quests, and post a question about that. Turns out no, I don't, so it turns out Manwe is being a tease too. Hrmmphh... 
</p>
<p>
My little mental note (see first post) to check spoiler on armor somewhere between CL15-CL20 has gone off, even though she's only CL13. I spend some time with a spreadsheet and figure out that it's well worth it to take off armor, cap and boots, but the cloak can stay for now: 
</p>
<p>
Starting AC=42 Soft Leather Armor (4,+0): take off -&gt; AC 58 Boots (2,+0) : take off -&gt; AC 62 Cap o' Infra (3,+1)(+3): take off -&gt; AC 63 (I thought about keeping the cap, but I've got 40' base infra, don't have to have 70'.) The cloak does not (yet) give a bonus AC upon its removal, so it stays. Plus, I like the stealth, even if it's only +1. 
</p>
<p>
Sold the armor, boots and cap, and gained 21 AC. Weird. Wish my Loremaster could do that! 
</p>
<p>
I wonder if this crossbow is going to cause me problems. I experiment a bit and find that to-hit, to-dam, &amp; fighting are all positively affected by the it. The weight of it (and future ammo) *WILL* affect Dodging, but I'm not worried about that for now. The bow will have to go, eventually, though. 
</p>
<p>
<em>Back to Bree:</em> From home, I grab 1 potion of speed and 3 shrooms of unhealth, just in case the pseudos are problematic. 
</p>
<p>
I only have 2 WORs, which worries me, but there's no more in Bree and I don't want to go to Gondolin. I'm itching to finish the Downs. But then I see that I'm also out of ID, so I go anyway. I drag along an un-ID'd staff and a sabre, doublecheck that I have enough scrolls of sat hunger, and set off to-

<p>
 I stop by the General Store. Mental note triggers and I grab 25 pints of fine wine. Slappy does have to celebrate getting that crossbow!!! She starts to party, and then I remember something important. FIRST I inscribe the Mushrooms of Unhealth with !E!E, and THEN I let her get blasted. (Just trying to stave off Murphy...) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Buy a few more flasks of oil. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>

 Pick up scrolls of ID. The staff is Nothing (literally) and the sabre's 0,0. Sell sabre, get 2 more ID scrolls (for what I wasted) and then get the only *ID* in the store.

</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I peek in the Black Market (the one that'll let me in &lt;g&gt;). Nice Orcish Pick, but it weighs 18 lbs. Hm, but there's also a Ring of Flames [+11] in there! Slappy's itchy fingers activate again and she cops it. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Side trip to Magic Shop shows a Ring of Protection [+10]. I sell the dang staff, then manage to nip the ring as well. This character MUST be lucky... I never have so much success stealing from shops, except w/ my Assassin character. It'll probably come back to bite me eventually. But that newly boosted AC 63 is now AC 84. Rah.

 Bought all the 0,0 arrows I could find - 36 - inscribed them and then enchanted them at the store. Belatedly, I realize that the Golden Flower is *VERY* overpriced (762 AU left!). Even more belatedly, I suddenly realize that I bought the wrong !@#%!#@%!#@%@ ammo! It's a crossbow, drat it all, not a bow! *Sigh* Must have been all that wine Slappy drank.

Selling the rest brings her up to 1000 AU even. So she feels slightly better.

 2 points to barehand and dodge. Barehand is currently maxed at 19.8, which means at CL16 I'll get another point of speed. Pseudos for this CL16 char are worth 100xp each, so the remaining 3 will take me halfway to CL16. And they do.

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Rbase is covered thanks to that lucky steal. I badly need resist confusion and resist fear, and I'll need see invisible soon. Poison isn't a huge problem yet, but I'm keeping CCW's around. Hm, I haven't been blinded yet, but that's probably just chance. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 IIRC, FA will come for free at Barehand 25 -- which is quite soon -- so that should be ok. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Levitate wouldn't hurt either, but that may be hard to come by. I usually get it on boots, but I don't want those, and rings are going to be at a premium. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I need spell ID, if I can get it. ID scrolls get expensive (though that'll change later), and carting heavy loot back to ID at home is messing up my Dodging. I did a bit of spreadsheeting on that too, but I'll comment on that later or edit it in. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 My little experiment in trying to guess the artifact didn't work too well, did it? &lt;g&gt;

<h4 id="head-69ddd1610f11a4933b769564d2bed98b6eb3c7e8">Continuing with CL18:</h4>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 I put 3 skill points into Dodging to bring it past 20. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Restock basics (CCW, Sat hunger, ID) a bit more. Buy some enchant armor scrolls hoping to put another AC point or two onto my +8 cloak. (Probably a waste.) 6 scrolls later, it's +9. I put a few more to-dam points on my crossbow and bolts while I'm at it. 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<h4 id="head-cf6297f9bf3926853a62dac07e65729216e81f66">Strategy: So what do I do now?</h4>
Assorted things cross my mind: 
    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Orc Caves. I always do this one before Old Forest, even though Old Forest is usually easier for me. Maybe it's because by the time I'm done with Orc Caves, most of the other early dungeons aren't so bad. This time around, I'm also interested in it because I can probably get positive Piety there, too. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Go to Lothlorien and get that Beastmaster quest &amp; the house there. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Dip into Mirkwood to test the waters. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Get the first God quest out of the way so I can have a chance of getting the 2nd one ASAP. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 After reading Circon's post, I'm also tempted to scum about a bit at the wilderness level around Angband to see if I can knock off a dragon or three. 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
After some mulling, I decide this: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Lothlorien first: 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
a) Load up on the stuff that needs to be sold and sell at Gondolin. b) Stop by Angband on the way back, while not carrying anything valuable. Try not to die. c) Stop at Bree, pick up whatever I want to take with, and relocate ops base to Lothlorien. d) Get the beastmaster quest and the house. I'm not worried about Wargs. 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 God quest. I'll probably see the entrance while overlanding to get to Lothlorien, since it's S of Bree and SW of Lothlorien. (I'm NOT going to try the north passage yet.) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Check first level of Mirkwood. Maybe finish a level or two if it's not that hard. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Orc Caves. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Old Forest. 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Subject to change of course, but that's the basic idea. 
</p>
<hr>
 <p>
Hm, do I donate Maggot's sling? I guess so. Though the bow is heavy, arrows are light, and carrying lots of shots or pebbles outweighs (literally) the bow. Not to mention the plusses on the crossbow 
</p>
<p>
<em>Gondolin:</em> 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Sell off weapons, as G's weaponsmith's cap is 30k. AU now at a tidy 63890. Buy up *ID*, some to-hit scrolls, CCW. Nothing worth stealing anywhere. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I consider dropping *ID*s at Bree first before Angband, but I can afford to lose them now. 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
<em>Surface wilderness at Angband:</em> 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 First off, I try coming in from the square south of Angband and do an absolutely wonderful impersonation of a greased pig on ice. Or a greased monk, anyway. Mental note: Get levitation. Wait, I already made that mental note. Hm. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I back off and come in from the jungle square east of Angband. This works fine, and I get in. Then I notice two things: It's night. And over THERE is a mature blue dragon: 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I creep up to it, then change to berserker/running (Speed +10). 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I manage to hit it 6 times (taking it down to ******) before it breathes lightning at me for 23hp. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I hit it 6 more times (a few misses). It hits me once in the midst of that. It dies.... 
</p>

 I'm heading for the Young Gold, but I'm near the bottom of the panel and another Black Ogre appears. Darn, there must be a cluster of them down there. Kill it and two more, the panel shifts, and it *looks* like that's it. Walk back and kill the Young Gold...

 I accidentally walk off the map, then back on. A bunch of stuff in my pack pseudo-IDs. Then I get: 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
It says: 'Kill, kill, kill. Let's play chess.' It says: 'Hey! WATCH IT! You almost hit me.' It says: 'You da Bomb!' 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Dang, a unique. It's either invisible or past the range of my light or infra. A bit of walking around proves it's invisible. I'll spare you the rest of the conversation, but poor Slappy was thoroughly insulted. (And btw, dear game devs: Carnal knowledge of oak trees would PROBABLY be illegal if any lawgivers had ever thought of that... ) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 A peek at my inventory shows that some of the pseudo-IDs are {average} or {worthless}. I drop them around myself, a few squares apart. I wander around, being regaled (and amused) by a VERY talkative Something. But it doesn't pick up the objects &amp; thereby reveal its location. I start a frenetic, totally random walk, *trying* to hit whatever it is, and utterly fail. I'm not kidding, I wasted a good 5-10 minutes on this! 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I start to wonder if this is some sort of joke, but I don't have joke monsters turned on. Then I start to think a bit more. Probably it is one heck of a lot faster than me and/or has very high AC, which implies that it's way more than I can handle if I *do* manage to aggravate it. Then I realize something else: It hasn't tried to hit me. Could it be neutral or coaligned? It doesn't sound particular friendly, but there's no way to tell. I'm out of here. I duck off the map. 
</p>
</li>

 I duck in and out of the Angband map a few times, destroying any {average} or worse items I find. Eventually a I find and kill a Mature Black Dragon (10 blows) takes me to....

 Hm. I'm always vaguely interested in the semi-randomized appearance of the ground cover in the towns. Apparently the Public Works dept. in Lothlorien does not like trees.

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Lots of water scattered around. I run into a patch of invisible beasties that release spores at me. (Gee, wonder what that is? ) I kill a bunch (noticing that I dodge quite a bit) and then wander off. And encounter.... mist? How cool, I've never seen that before. I kill something else invisible. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Trip an Ice Bolt Trap. OUCH! 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Something else invisible touches me for lose DEX, casts fear at me and wails at me. Some ghost-type. It teleports away. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 This is on the exterior corridor around one of those hollow-center special rooms. Inside, there's bunch of Clear Worm Masses. I go after them. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 In the midst of this I get: 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
"It sniggers." Huh??? Since when do things that wail at me snigger? It must be something else. In fact, it sounds an awful lot like... I take another two steps and suddenly there's this light blue 'h' amidst the 'w's and: "<strong>Smeagol</strong> misses you. &lt;2x&gt;" Hah! I hit him, stun him, stun him more...in fact, I beat the heck out of him, and he never lands a blow on me before he dies. Then I have to beat the worms out of the way (they've multiplied badly by now) and grab the ring. Smeagol's also dropped a Beaked Axe of *Slay Evil* (+2). Well, now I can be invisible, even if I can't SEE invisible I swap out the levitate ring, mainly because I don't want to lose the RoI to a passing thief and have to chase it down. I get out of there because the worms are out of control - I *should* have closed the door when I entered the room. They're not dangerous, just annoying. 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 There's an *awful* lot of invisible creatures around, darn it. Booty keeps appearing around me, even when I'm not the one walking into things and killing them. I keep hearing noise, too, of things killing each other. Maybe there's a Firebird somewhere? 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I find the source of the noise. There's one of those 4x4 inside a rectangle special rooms. I see a message I've never seen before: 'There's something scary in your way!' Hee hee hee. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I've discovered that this mist stuff surrounds the borders of every room and can hide paths to other rooms. So I'm doing a lot of "wandering in the mist." Very funny, dev-folks. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I finish scouring the first level. No relic (AFAICT - something invisible might have picked it up ) and the lack of SI is a royal pain. Still grumbling and wondering why I did this, I go down the stairs (or is that up?) to-

<p>
 I wander about through 4-5 rooms, cussing under my breath about the invisibles, when I suddenly spy something absolutely beautiful. The Relic! Yay..... Happy dance Manwe pats me on the head and I WOR out of this infernal place with drained WIS, DEX, &amp; CHA, a nearly full pack, 2.500 points of Prayer, and the Ring of Invisibility.

 Much to my amused chagrin, it turns out one that of the unidentified potions I picked up in the Temple was a Potion of Detect Invisible! Sheesh. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Other stuff in the haul included (do you care?): a 2nd ring of levitation, an amulet of infra, an amulet of spell - hm, might keep that - a wand of noxious cloud, staves of ID, sense hidden and reveal ways, 2 morphic oils of mouse, and a bunch of junk. I sell everything but the oils, amulet of spell (stashed those) and staves of sense hidden and reveal ways. Then I think again, pick up the spellbook of Manwe's Blessing (which includes cure fear), and stash the junkart as well. I may come back for it later.

 Oh yeah. Forgot to spend skill point on levelling. 1 to Barehand (maxed).

 Buy a parchment of advanced Sindarin from the Black Market and learn how to summon a dwarf. Cewl.

<hr>
 Where now? Umm.... Orc Caves or Mirkwood. I could do Mirkwood, but I think I'll take Orc Caves. I want to check for dungeon towns and get Deathwatch, and do it before I'm bored to tears by how easy it is. *knocks on wood!* Might have to drop by Angband again, too. <p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 I haven't used the crossbow since the Barrow Downs, but I'll carry it for the plusses for now. Question is, do I keep carrying the bolts? Answer... for a little while longer. I guess. Might be useful in getting something to chase me, as I don't have any other ranged attack. Better bolts would be nice. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Barehand is over 25, so I have FA. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I have resist or remove fear 3 different ways (Manwe, ring and junkart.) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I have levitation, if I want to give up the ring of damage or invisibility for it. I think I'll swap out the damage ring. This reduces my damage plus to +13 to-dam. A big hit, but I'll take it for now. The reason for this is that I'm anticipating lava and deep water coming up, and at these low levels, being invisible will do some good. I can always swap around later. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I *desperately* need SI and rconf! 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I can keep lugging around ID scrolls for now, but will look for better.

 Piety's gone down again, darn it. Time for orc mashing.

Recap: Done are Barrow Downs and the first God Quest. Have Bree and Lothlorien houses, am residing now in Lothlorien. Sore lack of SI and rconf, Pt -740. 
    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 After much skittishness, I bite the bullet and max out Dodging. As long as I'm playing a Monk, I might as well do it right. This leaves me with Dodging at 29.400, and 44 unspent skill points. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 It dawns on me that with negative piety, I can't cast Manwe spells. I dump the spellbook back at home and grab my junkart of cure fear/poison again. (Phew, I'm glad I thought of that.) [Edit: But I forgot to take off my ring of resist fear for something else. Doh!] 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Swing by Bree (nothing good at the BM), reveal Orc Caves on the Overland map, and can't resist one more swipe at the wilderness level of Angband. 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
<strong>Wilderness of Angband:</strong> 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Head straight after a mature green dragon. Hey, this dodging is a cool thing. It never hit me. OK, I'm a convert. Mature gold dragon, basilisk, hippogryph... oh, hello, Beorn! 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 It occurs to me that if I dump enough skill points into Monster Lore, I can get companions off of anything Beorn summons for me, even w/o summoning. This is VERY tempting, especially as the increment is 1.100. I hold off for now, but if FF ever gives me Monster-Lore as a best choice, this might be an option, as I'm sure I'll see Beorn again. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Bunch more dragons, storm giant, yadda yadda. Run into and kill The Wounded Bear. I think that unique is misplaced. It's weak enough that by the time you run into it, it's an easy kill. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 More kills, then a young bronze dragon takes me to-

    <li>
<p>
 One skill point into Barehand (this takes my bh speed modifier to +3) and two into Dodging, 46 left over. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I scum around a bit more and run into an Ettin. Well, he's a tad hard to kill, isn't he! I change to berserker/running, quaff 2 CCWs and get back to beating on him. It takes quite a lot of beating, and stunning, and dodging, but at last I kill it. 3000xp, thank you very much, and in the end I've only lost 30hp. (The sword it dropped was cursed, bah.) I change back to normal/brisk - there's a 25 AC difference between normal and berserker. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 A little way off, I see Thorondor, Lord of Eagles (level 30, unhurt) (coaligned). He wakes up. Immediately, I'm *SURE* Circon was right about the type of character I ran into before. Who'd'a'thunk Eagles were so chatty? 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I beat the heck out of bunch more mature dragons and other things and am about to leave (pack is full), when I notice I've less than 1000 xp left til CL27. I refresh the map to get more dragons, and very shortly later I'm at-

    <li>
<p>
 The last thing I killed was a mature white dragon. It left a corpse. I'm about to leave, then I pick up the corpse and take it with me. Just in case. At the very least it'll impress the townsfolk back at Bree 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 One skill point each into Barehand and Dodging. 49 left over. Thanks to all the draggies/etc, my Piety's now at -411. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Due to the weight of the corpse, I burn 4 scrolls of Satisfy Hunger between Angband and Bree, and dump the corpse in the house there. (This causes assorted mental images, including Slappy trying to shut the door on this great, big, armored tail poking out...)

 Boring. I find a shaft down and bypass it until I find a stair down.

<h5 id="head-136c17f133dab9f891ccfdde0c20b6348a48f16a">Orc Cave 11 / superb feeling:</h5>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Landed in a vertical oval room with a bunch of monsters, including a big clump of Manes. Kobolds, hippogryph, that sort of thing. Clean them out and notice Piety is at -327. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I'm using the staves to look for traps, doors, stairs etc. I blunder into a room full of novice paladins, novice priests, and jackals. Darn it. Afraid, I start to run for the stairs down when I remember I'm carrying that junkart. I use it and wade back in. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 WHOA. Certes, Manwe does not like priest-killing. Piety now -1387! 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The superb feeling comes from an Orc Pit: Snotlings, Hill Orcs, Black Orcs, Half-Orcs, Uruks and Elite Uruks. That's the good part. The bad part is that my pack is full, and that there's some sort of borer around, as the backside of the pit is holed and they're coming out that way, too. I don't use any particular tactics, just wade in. Main things I notice are that: a) Once again, I'm getting confused (not that it matters), b) I'm dodging magical attacks (first time I've seen this message), and c) I'm taking very little damage. By the time I'm done, my Piety is -895. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I wander a bit more, run into some Noice Mindcrafters, and get the 'afraid' thing again. My pack's full, so I WOR out.

    <li>
<p>
 Well lookee there. The Black Market has a Holy Tome of Manwe and a Feanorian Lamp. I steal both successfully, somewhat to my surprise. The lamp has radius 3 light, one better than the dwarven lantern. 
</p>
</li>

 I put 2 skill points each into Magic Device and Disarming, bring each of them up to or over 5.000. 45 left. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I notice I now am up to 4 blows per round, and have SOMEHOW acquired Extra Max Blow (1). I know I didn't buy that. Must be a monk thing. Do I get (2) later?? 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Uncurse kit (both rings got it), restock. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I unhappily swap the Ring of Invisibility for the Ring of Resist Fear. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Stat check: 4 blows/round, damage/round 8-288, normal/fast gives me +9 speed (remember I've got that xbow w/ +4 speed) with superb fighting &amp; bows, fair save and fair stealth. +15 to-hit and to-dam. 103072 AU, Pt still rots at -911.

 Bunch of wolves. See my first Firebird (Blue) and find my first Rod Tip (Acid Balls). Firebird helps a little and then dies to an undead mass before I leave the room. Wander a little, find a stair and go down-

 Huh, that's unusual: two Green Firebirds in the same room.

    <li>
<p>
 I run into Flying Skulls for the first time.

</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I enter one of those open rooms (one Firebird is already gone) to find clusters of Novice Mindcrafters and Novice Mages, Hill orcs, a Baby Blue Dragon, Large Kobold Shaman, hand a spattering of other things. The remaining Firebird lasts a surprising time, then dies. I don't have too much trouble except for the darn Mages, who keep blinding me. I get confused a time or two as well.

 I'm rooting through the booty when I suddenly realize that a cap in my pack has pseudo-ID'd as {special}! It IDs as the <em>Hard Leather Cap of Curindor [2,+5].</em> Probably a randart.

</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I'd been intending to WOR out first thing (my pack is full) but I just keep going. Run into a pack of Hill Orcs w/ a Hill Orc Shaman, then another similar pack. Then a stack of Snagas with a Snaga Captain. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Bunch of booty, I end up destroying an empty Staff of Reveal Ways to take a Wand of Manathrust [3|16], etc. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Then a pack of Cave Orcs. Then a pack of Brown Yeeks. What is this?!? I'm not complaining, there's just a lot of monsters around. They aren't coming from a pit, either. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I round the corner, and the explanation rapidly becomes clear. Standing side by side in a coridor are Orfax, Son of Boldor *and* Vort the Kobold Queen, plus escorts. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Just to be helpful, Orfax summons more escorts, including a shaman and an archer, then blinks away.

    <li>
<p>
 Luckily I'm standing right next to Vort, so I ignore the others and beat on her. 5 blows kill her.

<p>
 Something out of view summons help - it may be Orfax come back. I take a few steps... yup, it's him. My first double-kick stuns him, and two more blows kill him. That was easy. Then I turn around and chew up the escort. Nothing interesting in the drops, just a few good items.

 RAH! Coolness. I wander about and... huh, this is odd. There are stores right in the corridor. You have to enter the shop to keep going down the corridor. Must be something about room generation in the Orc Caves? 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The RNG hates me. The first shop I run into is a Dragon Hunter store, with all sorts of Dragon Scale Mail. Let's see: Black, Blue, White, Red, Green, Pseudo, Law, Bronze and Gold. None of which I can wear. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I continue along this weird corridor. Next shop is a Footwear Shop. Fortunately, no BOS to torment me. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Darnit, I just killed a Priest. Must remember.... 
</p>

    <li>
<p>
 Walk smack into Bullroarer the Hobbit! I'm about to decide if I should destroy any of my inventory to pick up his drop, when I see some Forest Trolls for the first time. I move out of the corridor and into one of those big open areas. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 There's a lot more Forest Trolls and Black Orcs too (w/ shamans etc), and right in the middle of them is Brodda, the Easterling. What *IS* this place, party central?!? 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I kill Brodda easily, then something hits me, blinds me, confuses me, and drains experience (twice) as well! It's still hitting me, so I drink a CCW and see a Spectral Baby green dragon. Sheeze. Fortunately it's only a baby one and I kill it easily enough, but I am now very, very paranoid.... 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I go back, poking through the mess - there's now booty spread over a huge area. Underneath the corpse of a Forest Troll, I find an Expensive Black Market. Sadly, there's nothing in there I want. Well, wait. There is a ring of rconf. [Edit: Which I forget to try to steal because of what next happens.] 
</p>

 I finish cleanup, and go looking for more stores. And who do I run into but Mughash, the Kobold Lord. Did I say sheesh already?? Once done with him, I find a Long Bow (x5), that should be a keeper.

 A bit more searching turns up a Common Shop. I buy a few CCW (don't need them, but all these uniques have me paranoid.)

 Next up: a Master Archer shop. Nothing I want though. That's the last of them. I WOR out - that way when I come back down, I can check the EBM again.

</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The bow Mughash dropped is a Long Bow of Lothlorien (x5) (+11,+16) (+2) -- the second one I've ever seen. It has +2 dex, FA, SI, extra might firing and blessed. I might have to take off my artifact bow 'Hirth' and wield this thing for the SI! Rghhh.... +4 speed, STR, DEX, WIS &amp; INT vs. SI.

 Well, the RNG still hates me. This time the Footwear Store does have Boots of Speed (only +5). My spreadsheet tells me wearing boots will cost me 10-11 AC (I'm not sure how it rounds), and the boots are [2,+8]. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I continue to explore, still mulling those boots. I'm about to report that the whole map is AFAICT exactly the same as last time, but without all the uniques this time, when I run into Ufthak of Cirith Ungol plus all his little friends in a room. I wade in and kill him, then realize I'm getting beaten up; I'm totally surrounded. I switch to berserker/running and back out until I'm in the corridor leading to the room. Then use the pedo mellon a minno inscription and sit back to.... what? They're crossing it! What gives? Well, fine. I'm at 159/244 hitpoints (and -3767 piety, how did *THAT* happen? ). I quaff some CCW and kill the rest. This piety thing is really starting to irritate me. I should have stuck with Eru after all

 Next room is very full of hill &amp; black orcs - no uniques that I saw, though. I kill them off, then discover that in the OTHER half of the rather large room, white worm masses have been breeding. I pick up a large wooden chest and beat it, closing the door after me.

 Thinking I'm heading to safety, I open another door and am confronted by a fairly large group of Fire &amp; Light Hounds, and beyond them, a stack of snotlings. Oh bother.

 I correct my skills spreadsheet *AGAIN* (thanks, Vagabond!) and experiment a little. The weight of my inventory really doesn't matter all that much. However, it turns out that while the 1.0 lb cloak doesn't make a big difference to armor class, it makes an ENORMOUS difference to Dodging. With the cloak, the dodge change for a melee attack by a L30 monster is (if I've got this right) 71.44%. Without the cloak, it's 91.44%. <p>
The cloak comes off (bye-bye 8 pts of stealth) and just so I can't change my mind later, I destroy it. Slappy is now completely armorless (and, I suppose, a Nudist Abbess of Pain. ) I notice that when I took off an AC 9 cloak, my AC only dropped 3 points from 100 to 97. 
</p>
<p>
Spot check: AC 97, 138740 AU, -3413 Piety (sigh), 4 blows/round, 8-288 dam/round, 244 hitpoints. Currently in my pack: junkart of remove fear/cure poison, 42 CCW, 5 scrolls of teleportation, 4 WOR, 40 ID, 10 satisfy hunger, a Wand of Manathrust [3|15] (13 charges) and 25 empty bottles.

 I land in the middle of what seems to be a destroyed area with a bunch of Ogres, Ogrillons, and some Clear Hounds. I go after the hounds as the Ogres seem to be napping, and after killing a number of them, I notice in the distance a bright yellow 'h' which turns out to be Nar, the Dwarf. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Nar is napping and lets me creep right up next to him. I change to berserker/running, and let him have it. In 12 blows, he's dead. I've missed him a few times. He never hit me at all - he missed a few times, and I dodged 3 times. He drops a corpse, and I pick it up (it's less than 200 lbs.) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I go after the Ogrillons and kill a number of them. Then a Tengu sneaks up behind me and teleports me away to a smallish, oddshaped room filled with.. let's see... 38 Ogres, Black Ogres and Ogrillons. There's priests and archers in the mix. (Gee, I wonder if killing ogre priests upsets Manwe? I'm really getting tired of him!) I'm completely surrounded, and fight my way off to a corridor to keep the bulk of them coming at me one at a time. I polish them off, then a mini-horde of snagas and novice warriors comes at me from the other end of the corridor.

 Stocking up for Deathwatch: I swap my Ring of Levitation for Ring of Invisibility.

(Yes, overkill, but I don't have that many scrolls of mapping. I'll save those for when I want to see where I am quickly.) Plus basic restock, though more CCW than usual: 51. I've only done this quest once or twice, since my older characters didn't realize what they are missing.

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 I land in a room with 29 cave and half-orcs including a captain, shamans and archers, 6 air hounds, 10 energy hounds, and assorted other critters. I hate hounds. This is going to hurt. I have to say that this 'visible monsters' list is a wonderful thing. I've only just started using it the last week or so and I'm a total convert. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I start wading into the energy hounds. The air hounds are on the other side of cave orcs from me, so they are helpfully killing off some of the orcs, and in fact some of the air hounds, too. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Ack! I'm down to 72/244. I don't have rpoison. I quaff a CCW, do a 180 back towards the air hounds - what a dummy I am - quaff 2 more (112/257), and...- 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<h4 id="head-ebad1800a1eeb31e35ac062377b335fdccadad55">CL28</h4>

<p>
 Dump 1 pt to barehand, 2 to dodging 
</p>

    <li>

 ...shoot one air hound, trip a Lightning Bolt trap (ouch!) and kill the last, getting poisoned again in the process. Whew. 82/257. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Meanwhile, the Cave orc Shamans have figured out where I am despite my invisibility, and are gleefully casting magic missile me. I've been even more gleefully dodging them - I don't think a single one has hit. 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
The archers are just plain missing me. Oops, the shaman finally gets lucky and confuses me. I quaff 6 CCWs and look around. Everyone's milling all over because I'm invisible. 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 I start hunting down the remaining and trip another trap. Then miskey and accidentally quaff a potion of speed instead of CCW. Argh. (At this rate I'm going to HAVE to recall before Deathwatch, if only to replenish my CCWs.) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Ho, I find another Potion of Speed in the booty as I'm cleaning up! Then I trip another trap. Slappy is now an "It". Figures. Then a Blink Dog (what?! Oh, it came down a corridor) teleports me a short way. I kill it and go back. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 What next happens is a bit confusing, but basically the slain Blink Dog was somewhat revenged, because his 25 packmates proceed to play with me like a pingpong ball, plopping me down randomly around orcs and manes/undead. I finally kill them all, get back to the room I was TRYING to clear, clear it, and as I'm cleaning up, I step on a Fire Ball Trap. Thank goodness I have rfire, but I'm still back down to 95/257 hp. Ouch. I rest. One more attempt to get the treasure sitting on the trap (via disarming, of course) trips it again and I desist. I burn a scroll of trap detection to make sure the next trap doesn't kill me. That was the last trap. Figures. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Well, darn it. I should have just teleported out of this room and gone on down to Deathwatch, but Deathwatch has big clusters too (though fortunately no hounds!!!) and I was curious how hard I could push Slappy. I could *probably* go on, but I want to be sure I've enough CCWs. WOR-

<p>
 I'm happy now. I have 57 CCW, and I pick up 8 scrolls of blessing for luck. This is probably way overkill, but that last room was a bit scary and I really don't want to lose this character. I'm carrying a lot of stuff (118% of capacity) but I'm not slowed, and experimenting with my spreadsheet has shown me that total inventory weight doesn't impact Dodging *too* badly. Plus I can easily afford to destroy most of what I don't use. WOR down-

<p>
 Alright, this time I'm not messing around. I land amidst a semi-destroyed room (if you know what I mean) with a pile of orcs. I zap my cute little wooden rod of door/stair location, don't see any stairs down, pick a random direction and plow through. (And see another Blink Dog. Ugh.) Light hounds, more orc types. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Ahah, there's a stair. On the way toward it, *more* orcs. I wonder if there's another unique around. A fountain: turns out to be Resistance. I drain it. I'm getting mobbed by Phantom Warriors, Light Hounds (ha - I have intrinsic rlight), Rotting Corpses and Snotlings, but I haven't lost any hp. 
</p>
</li>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 This level looks filled with evilness. Whee! 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I don't remember, do you always enter Deathwatch in the same place? I think so.. Anyway, I'm in a tiny little room. Magic Mapping shows me small adjacent rooms and a path leading towards something that IIRC is a large open area (mapping radius doesn't go that far.) I kill a few assorted snagas and find a fortune cookie. On a whim, I eat it. It says: "Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!" I take this as a good omen 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Yup, there's that open area. How spoily should I be? Well, we're in the spoilers section. I'm not going to tell you where the artifacts are, though! But this open area, there's a lot of snagas, orcs, uruks etc that are more or less evenly spaced out. I duck back out and continue up a corridor, on the left hand side of the map, kill a a few more critters including a skeleton snaga, then enter the main area. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Like I said, I'm on normal/normal, so my speed is only +5, so my stealth is 'excellent'. I start killing the spaced out critters one by one, and the rest are not (yet, anyway) waking up. There's Lagduf, the Snaga, somewhat in the middle, surrounded by (the remaining) 20 or so orclikes. I progress directly towards Lagduf and kill him. He drops a robe and a lance. A couple of cave orcs have woken and are milling around. The lance is heavy and has slowed me. I destroy it. Really, none of this stuff is anything I can use, so I'm likely to sell all of it, which the possible exceptions of Cammithrin and Maedhros. I polish off all the rest (I'm feeling much better now). Orcs have opened the doors from both the north and the south. I guess I'll go north. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Nothing difficult here - skeleton cave orc and a uruk captain are the worst so far. In the process, I see an interesting message: "You kick the Snaga in the ankle./The Snaga starts limping slower." Do monk attacks actually cause slowing? (It makes sense, if it does.) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 So far, no interesting booty. On my way back through the open area, though, I go to the two trunks I left behind before. I fail to disarm both of them and both blow in my face. (I definitely do need to do something about that.) One has only AU. The other yields a Rapier of Extra Attacks (1d6) (+14,+19) (+1 attack). 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I head down from the open area, explore it, then go west of the open area, reading another scroll of magic mapping as I do. Hill orcs, Black orcs, Ogrillons, and yup, there's Grishnakh, the Hill Orc. I take out the shaman first, then Grishnakh (that was easy). 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 In clearing out the area north of Grishnakh, I find a Potion of Wisdom. Yay. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Going south/west (as it were), more of the same orc types. This is really not difficult at all; that dumb room one DL up from here was much, much harder. So I'm feeling rather foolish now at all my elaborate preparations. Still, I seem to remember the last unique being a little harder, and there could have been random unique(s), too. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I round the corner and there's Golfimbul, the Hill Orc, with his buddies. The escort (less the ones I've already killed and those out of sight) is around 25 black orcs, half orcs and ogrillons. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I remember this now. It's a bigger escort. I get confused, and am suddenly down to 176/257, I'm not sure by what. I'm dodging magical attacks again. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I back into a corner - there's a little 2x2 room there with a door - and let them come at me while I chug a CCW. It gorges me (?!?) but I'm back to normal quickly, but still only 190/257. I cuss, shut the door, and chug another before they open it again. This time I don't get gorged. 211/257, fine. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I emerge, kill a bunch of them, get confused, and CCW again. I'm surprised I don't get gorged. There's fewer of them now, and I finally reach Golfimbul. 5 blows kill him. I almost miss that I did kill him because more escort is coming at me. I go straight after the one remaining shaman and kill it. Remaining cleanup is easy. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 In the mess, I find: wand of magelock, potion of curing, pot of berserk strength, a Short Sword of Westernesse (1d7) (+7,+3) (+2), a rod tip of door/stair location, and a bunch of junk (good/normal/cursed items.) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Down underneath this area, I come across a potion of healing. A trunk yields a good jewel encrusted crown (ah well) and a good war hammer. My pack is full, so I destroy my scrolls of blessing to carry the potion. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Now I have a problem. I know where I have to go to get out - magic mapping makes that clear - but I can NOT make that dumb door appear! Digging is not working - 'You fail to make even the slightest of progress.' My piety is slowly creeping downward as I search at it (it was around -2000 for a while there, darn it.) I change my exploration to slug-like (giving me 'excellent' searching) and try again. No luck. 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
I alternately search and dig until I've lost over 500 piety. Alright. Well, I've found all three artifacts, so maybe I should just WOR out of here and recall back, but this is irritating in the extreme. 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Sidenote: VERY oddly, Cammithrin's hiding place was open when I got there. There must have been an orclike in there with it and it got out. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I search until I lose over 800 piety. Heck with it. I'm quite vexed. (Actually I'm more than that, but we're supposed to use decent language here, so....) I WOR out-

    <li>
<p>
 Actually it's a good thing I have all this leftover stuff from my over-preparation for Deathwatch. Might well need it here. There's a *BIG* open area with just a few intervening walls and.... fire hounds, dark houds, trolls, and a bunchof others. And there's probably more I can't see. I'm not wearing that invisibility ring any more (maybe that was a bad move) so they're all after me. I switch to berserker/running and duck around a corner. This lets me pick off a few, but the dark hounds blind me four times running, so I CCW *again* and read a scroll of teleport. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I land in a corridor. Whew. I read another magic mapping and see a smallish, irregular sectioned room very close and head for it. There's Ugluk, the Uruk with 18 orclikes, a quasit, 4 cold hounds and a blue yeek. Heh - the blue yeek must be the message boy, ya think? 
</p>

<p>
 A bit of moving around reveals fire, air and acid hounds as well, plus more orclikes and some undead. Yippee

 I go straight for the Air Hounds. Lesson learned, yup! There's a darn wererat in here along with a cluster of other rats - that's odd, but I don't see any uniques. I hope to heck it doesn't start summoning. There's also some darn snaga shamans who start casting confusion. Next: the acid hounds, unless I can get at that wererat.

 I suddenly realise I'm standing right next to Ugluk. I tear into him, but he takes some killing. 16 blows (that landed; I missed him some, too). While scrolling back in recall to count those, I notice that a) the hounds are damaging everything, including Ugluk, and b) I'm doing a LOT of dodging and stunning, this despite the fact that my pack is stuffed. I'm down to 172/257.

 Much better. I kill them in ones and twos. The wererat (I *hope* it's the original one) comes out a different door and I shoot it with a few bolts. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I go through a lot of the beasties and move back into the room... and discover in the process that Mr. Wererat has been doing what Mr. Wererat does best... summoning. I think I'm on top of it for a bit, then I turn a corner and realize it's hopeless. I read a scroll of teleport and wind up right back in that huge room I started in. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The *moment* I land I swap back to normal/normal, for the stealth. I take a few steps and get blinded 3 times in a row by those darn dark hounds again. I CCW, change to running, and dodge behind a partial wall. Resting gives me a few hp, then the fire hounds arrive, a cluster of three. I kill a number of them and some other things, then the dark hounds catch up. Blind again. A number of times. Darn it. Obviously rblind would be helpful, eh? 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I start using my head *AND* my lovely crossbow, targeting the dark hounds as they appear. This helps immensely. Mental note: I'm now walking on - well, over - lava. Taking levitation over invis was a good thing. What would have been smarter was to have BOTH and leave the dumb r of fear res behind and use my junkart instead. I don't know wha tI was thinking when I did that. Probably just forgot. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I think I've killed most of them. I creep out, rather cautiously, and run into an Ogrillon Mage. Fortunately I surprise it - that could have been nasty. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 There are Gnome Mages and Forest troll Priests roaming around in here, archers and other things. I'm hovering around 160/257 or so, and pillar dodging a bit around one little square of wall out in the middle of this big area. I'm trying to figure out where the bulk of them are coming from. I take a chance, and find another half-wall to hide behind, then take out assorted Ogrillons one by one, resting to heal a little until the next one appears. I notice that 'ankle kick/limping slower' message again. This time I check the online help: yup, that particular attack has a chance of slowing. Cewl. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 My goodness, I got them all. (I was going to count for you, but there were WAY too many.) I peek out, then read a scroll of light I found. Well, ok, there's a little Grey Mold over there in the corner, minding its own business. I let it alone. Moving along, I run into a pack of Gnome Mages. I kill some, the others scatter. In the spoil I find a Wand of Dig. Did I mention the RNG hates me?!? I also find a Staff of Remove Curses, which I use, and another of Identify. A scroll of enchant to-dam successfully enchants my crossbow up another point. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 So where is Azog? I start exploring, and get close to that last place with all the wererats/etc is. I see an odd sight: wall sections disappearing, some distance away from me in that same wererat room. (I don't think I have telepathy or whatever...weird.) 'There is a grinding sound.' A pair of rock moles. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 On down the corridor... Gorbag, the Orc Captain. With *lots* of friends. I move into the room. Gorbag was apparently brought along by his buddy, Azog, King of the Uruk-Hai. And at least 37 black orcs and uruks plus assorteds. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Azog is right by the entrance to the room, so I'm already hand to hand with him while everyone else is still clustered up. (I have a screen dump of this, but it's just a bunch of 'o's. If anyone really wants to see it, ask.) I hit him a few times, then.... oh, d***. Blink Dogs. I get teleported, then see what else is in the room. More Dogs (only about 6 or so, I hope...and... ack, a Shrieker mushroom patch! I shoot the shrieker immediately. I don't think it sounded off... 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I get pogo'd around by Blink Dogs a bit, then I see a Ranger, who promptly summons a pack of white wolves. Gee thanks. I'm completely mobbed but taking little damage (knock on wood.) I surrender to the inevitable and wait for a Blink Dog to move me nearer that Ranger. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Current visible monster list is 11 wolves, 12 black orcs, 8 forest trolls, a pair of blink dogs, 16 uruks, the ranger, Gorbag and Azog. I get a clear shot and shoot the ranger. (I have a screen shot of around now, too.) 180/257 hp. I wish I hadn't dumped those potions of speed back in my house, but to be fair, those hounds would probably have shattered them all. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Gorbag starts hitting me. Well, actually, trying to. He's missing consistently. I quaff a few CCW (other attacks are landing, mostly arrows from the uruks) and my one potion of invisibility. I fight my way down towards a corridor, and reach it, with 149/257. It's a darned good thing I had so many CCW - the hounds and some traps broke a bunch of them, I've quaffed many, and I have 33 left. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I'm chugging more CCW (I'm not going to track them right now, I need to pay attention.) I kill a bunch of orclikes, then Gorbag gets to me. I kill him. Azog looks on and wonders aloud how many XP I'm worth... 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Azog was right behind Gorbag; we fight, I kill him. He never managed to even touch me. Cewl. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 A looooong fight later, the double-escort is finally dead. Azog has dropped Thrain, and there's a Harp of the Eldar (+2). The rest is stuff like Ring of Sustain Charisma &amp; rfire, a staff of ID (which I keep) and good weapons (which I don't). Good thing I found that staff, as my stack of 70-odd ID scrolls is now gone. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I wander around and go back into that rat room to try to scoop up some more booty. Guess what? The Rat King was there after all! I find him alone and send him to rat heaven. Unfortunatley the wererat(s) are still summoning, so I teleport back out again. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I explore the rest of the level, then see if I can't sneak up on the rats from a different direction. It works, for a while, and I kill a number of wererats and others. Then I'm poisoned. I start trying to back away. A wererat summons other wererats on several sides of me, something casts noxious cloud, and now I'm around 70 hp. I read another scroll of teleport....well, no, actually, I don't. I'm either out of them or my last one(s) burnt up. This is not good. I chug CCWs, read a WOR and head for the closest exit, which leads to a corridor that can, a ways away, be blocked off by closing doors. This works. I close the doors and rest, waiting for recall, when the door on the rat side doesn't just open, it vanishes, destroyed by a rock mole. I kill it, and am immediately yanked back up to-

 Whew, I'm glad that's over with! I ID the last few things in my pack, and come up with a Shocking Metal Boomerang (3d4) (+5,+6). I sell quite a bit, though I'm hanging on to the Deathwatch artifacts since the weaponsmith at Lorien caps at 10k.

 Restock some. It's night, I'll nap at the Inn to refresh the shops. But I steal a potion of dex from the BM before I do. (I forgot to check how many CCWs I'd used before I restocked somewhat, but I'm guessing I used approx 45.) I remember to swap the ring of rfear for invisibility. I nap, restock, and check with Galadriel just in case. I stop by the BM and see a very beautiful thing. A Potion of Experience, 25% off, for 63525 AU. I buy it.

And this is pretty consistent with what I saw: what caused the most damage were missile and spell attacks...and traps. Most monsters couldn't lay a finger on me. In fact, I'm not sure if anyone did... I wasn't watching that closely, but I didn't see it ever happen. <h5 id="head-580a776c6b642fccec58ff95f40d16a839dd873b-3">Observations:</h5>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Dodging *ROCKS*. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Deathwatch is a piece of cake, but the bottom of Orc Caves is no joke for a character without rpoison and an area-based attack. The lack of rconf/SI/etc didn't help either, despite my high "AC" and speed. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Getting rpoison is now a major priority. The biggest issue is that I can find all sorts of rings and amulets, but I need ones that have multiple resists/powers...and the problem with those is they are hard to find. And rpoison is going to become rapidly more important. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I've very glad I held onto the ammo for my crossbow. It came in quite useful a few times as a semi-substitute for an area attack. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Did I mention I'm not thrilled with Manwe? I still can't figure out why I had that sudden drop in piety that took me down to -3000ish. Does killing *evil* priests bother him, too? 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Slime molds eaten: 3 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Heaviest thing I'm now carrying is ID scrolls. Still looking for rod bits, but from experience, ID-types are a lot deeper. Staves don't carry enough charges for my needs, unless I carry a bunch of them, and that weighs too much. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I make stupid mistakes, that's obvious. But I bet you do, too 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Still sitting on skill points in wait of FF. I know I'm sadly lacking in a lot of basic skills. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I keep wondering what Music ability would do for this character... but unless someone tries to go out of their way to convert me, I'll probably not go there. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I'm also considering Possession. The few times I've tried it before I always have died messily, and it scares me a bit, but I do have that dragon corpse burning a hole in my pocket. If FF offers it and there's nothing else screamingly better, I'll try it. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Also still contemplating those supplementary magic schools Manwe gives access to. 
</p>

<p>
The next installment? Some of the following, anyway. 
</p>
<p>
First, I think I'll going to grab that FF quest I know is waiting in Mirkwood. Then, I don't know. Probably the Old Forest (being careful of that Death Fate) or the Maze. Lothlorien Old Mages &amp; Lothlorien spider quests. And maybe some more Angband dragon scumming tossed in Possibly even REAL Angband scumming, assuming I'm allowed down the stairs... I need *good* rings/amulets. But not til I get rpoison I may be silly, but I'm not insane. 
</p>
<p>
Has anyone ever seen a 5-headed hydra south of Bree? Or know a good place to find one? *Wanders away, muttering about beastmaster quests...*

<em>Lothlorien:</em> 
    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 First thing I do is stop praying. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I researched the whole Spirituality affecting Saving Throw thing. I put three skill points in for now, bringing me to 3.700. I also look again at the magical schools Manwe gives access. The Temporal school is the most attractive one. But do I really want to burn 30 skill points just to be able to cast Essence of Speed? (Twelve points to get Grow Trees might win out, eventually...) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I still want some free beastcraft points, and I have a quest for a 5-headed hydra A little research reveals they are L28, though I doubt that will help me much... 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Housecleaning time. I research Nar and get rid of his corpse, then gather up artifacts/etc and cart them off to Bree. 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
<em>Bree:</em> Dump stuff in house except for the West sword I want to sell in Gondolin. I buy more CCW, ID, *ID* (for stockpile), and teleport scrolls. 
</p>
<p>
<em>Gondolin:</em> 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Sell the sword, stock more CCW, ID, trap detection, yadda yadda. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Black Market has an Iron Rod. I buy it. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I've been looking for some time now for a Wand of Noxious Cloud. There isn't one here, either. But I do get a Staff of Disarm (which feels horribly clunky to me; oh well.) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Angband is calling me, but I'm carrying something like 70lbs of scrolls by now, so back to Bree real quick to dump them off- 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
<em>Bree, thence to Angband wilderness:</em> 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 I see the first dragon (takes a little searching, as it's nighttime) and start praying again. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Two large chests in a row from two dragons... and they are both empty. Hmmf! 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I see a mature gold dragon. I've killed them before with this character. This time, the dragon only manages to claw me once (for 2hp, hee), and I easily kill it. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 There's one of those Windlords around, I think. I can't see it, but the chatter is unmistakable. I LOL about some architectural comments. Ah, there he is, it's Gwaihir. He helps me out for a while, and then I refresh the map. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I switch to coward and test the Angband stairs. Still can't get in. I leave coward on to see how it fights. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I cruise around the map a number of times killing assorted dragons and bears. Day comes, and I soon find Thorondor, Lord of Eagles, who shows up just in time to swipe the xp for a mature black dragon from me. Oh well. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I've got about 1000xp left til CL30. I go off the bottom of the map to lose my chatty friend and refresh the map, and soon find a Mature gold dragon. This one doesn't touch me at all, even set on coward, and-

1 point each to Barehand and Dodging. A couple more dragons (including a mature red) and there's another mature gold. It scares me, but I've got that junkart that removes fear - and then I kill it. And THEN I remember I didn't turn on praying. Heck with it. I leave it turned on until I'm ready to leave, which is a handful of dragons later- <p>
In overland travel, I stop by the Old Forest, go down the stair, then back up, in order to add it to my recall list. Then- 
</p>
<p>
<em>Bree:</em> Sell a few things such as rings of spell/etc, pick up all those scrolls/etc I left there, and head back to- 
</p>
<p>
<em>Lothlorien:</em>

    <li>
<p>
 I got another fate on the way back. This time it's an innocuous one: Staff of Globe of Light on DL1. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Stash stuff in house and check the shops. I finally find a Wand of Noxious Cloud.

    <li>
<p>
 The vortices start coming at me through the trees pretty quickly, but I can move through the trees, too, and I am - I think - a little faster than they are. A quick check of the map shows this is a fairly small level, which is why they are coming at me so fast. By the time I've explored two rooms and a handful of corridors, I've already killed 16 of the 18. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Next room holds a pile of novice paladins, who terrify me (in more ways than one) so I duck into the trees. There's a clump of snotlings, a baby dragon or three, that sort of thing, too. 17 of 18 somewhere along the way. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I wander around for a while looking for those last two vortices. Then find a racetrack room with some minor undead, a master yeek and a dark elven priest inside. The priest drops a staff of sense monsters, how convenient! The last cold vortex is actually very close by, coming up on me through the trees. I go to meet it-

 Rah!! I was only going to do one more level, but for another FF, sure, I'll beat up some swamp things. 
</p>

 My nifty new precognition ability shows me several swamp things in the area, a mold, and a druid. Hm, I think druids count as priests. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 There's a greensward and the swamp things are coming up it rapidly. Can they treewalk? I can't tell. All I know is that maybe 5-6 seconds have gone by and 7 of them are dead. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>

 I go to dump to oook again. When working FF quests, I dump to oook very frequently so I can check current skills. I could write them down, I know, but I'm lazy.

    <li>
<p>
 About half a minute later, 15 out of 18 are dead. I went down a long corridor to the map wall, crossed over through the trees to another corridor, and they were all stacked up like neat little bowling pins. How convenient....

</li>
    <li>

 I find a special room, kill another swamp thing, and discover that I'm getting better at disarming traps. 4 in a row (detected by my staff) with no disasters--knock on wood. On the floor, I find a Ring of Critical Hits (+1%). The RNG is taunting me!

 Another greensward. That's what I think of them as, anyway, but they are "small trees" so I guess most people would consider them as walkable trees.

MAJOR MENTAL NOTE: Death fate on DL18, don't get carried away. 
    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 I was planning on Old Forest first, but this is seductive. Oh well. The thing with Wererats, though, is that they are summoners. I don't have an area attack aside from my spiffy new wand of noxious cloud, which has...how many charges? Seven. Hmm. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I circle around the level through the trees, using precog to look for the princess. This is a big level. I go around a big part of the perimeter without finding her, then see a room with crypt creeps and a few other evil things, turn on praying, and go after them. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I finally see a pair of wererats on the edge of some small trees (I'll try to remember to call them that), and come up on them through the bigger trees and kill them. That's 2 out of 5, but I forgot to turn on praying. Heck with it, I'll leave it on for now. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>

 A few steps more and I see that the small trees are just the ring around the princess room. I switch to coward/running. The three remaining Wererats are quickly slain -- with no summoning, thank Eru!

I turn off praying. (Oh yeah, thank Manwe, too ) <em>The princess offers:</em> Hatchet Small Metal Boomerang Pair of Soft Leather Boots Hrrrrrrm. I'm always tempted by boots whenever I see them, but I think it'll have to be the Boomerang. The chance that it *might* be Beor, for a character like this, is too much to pass up......Groan, it's not. <em>Boomerang of Slay Dragon.</em> Oh well. I couldn't have used either of the other two anyway. (And yes, that *is* sour grapes ) I've only explored about half the level, but down the stairs anyway (while I reset back to brisk speed.)

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The princess room is VERY close to where I landed. I precog where one crawler is at and come up at it through the trees. Easy enough to kill, and I manage about 8 or so of them as I circle around the edge of the room. But this is the first *lava* princess room I've seen so far. Drat. I continue to circle and kill the crawlers, and encounter some dark hounds, one of which blinds me. I retreat into the trees, heal, and precog what's nearby. Just one hound left, and the last crawler right next to it. I kill the hound first, then the crawler.

<em>The princess offers:</em> Thunderlord Coat Ring Mail Leather Scale Mail Well, this is worthless to me! It's time to play "Guess the Artifact" again. AFAIK, there's one coat that's an artifact but it's a guaranteed drop. I do a little searching on oook. There's another coat artifact, much rarer. There are no ring mail artifacts, and I already have the only leather scale mail artifact. Soooo... Either that's a very rare t-lord coat, or I'm dealing with a randart, so essentially it's a c**p-shoot. I pick the coat. Now I just have to get across the lava, and I'm not thrilled with that. First off I change from coward/brisk to coward/running - though I'm not sure that'll actually help any. Does it? Examination of the princess room shows that the north side of the moat is only two squares deep, as opposed to 3 to 5 elsewhere.

 Well, that figures. I land in a room with an insect swarm and the next one has a pile of half-orcs and clear hounds. I remember to turn on praying again. When the dust has settled, I find a junkart and a Wand of Slow Monster. My pack is full, so I destroy a weapon for the junkart (I have no *ID* on me) and since I just found a second and better staff of Sense Hidden, I destroy the first one to get the wand.

 I find a fountain of infravision. I've heard of really good fountains, but I think the best I've found are CCW and Resistance -- I've only recently started carrying bottles to test them.

 A tengu (I'd seen it earlier, but it'd blinked away) teleports me off someplace. Within precog range, a scruffy hobbit, a skeleton orc, and a mold of some type. I check the map and see a 'p' southwest of me, move about a room or so, and sure enough, it's Angamaite of Umbar. He takes a fair amount of killing, but never touches me. He drops a good Fauchard which I don't take with me.

Yup, back home. The junkart doesn't sell and turns out to be for Summon Monster. <p>
I posted this now because the next bit will probably be long again. Plus, I wanted to gloat about the Mindcraft! More to come... I'll probably go do Old Forest after this. <h3 id="head-e0fd8645122f75b504288da0ba08c6fe92b92dac">A Day in the Life #7: CL30-32 (Lothlorien spider quest and the Old Forest)</h3>
Recap: Barrow Downs, 1st God Quest, and Orc Caves are done. Partway down Mirkwood. Have houses in Bree and Lothlorien; residing in Lothlorien. I need (among other things) rpoison, SI, rconf, rblind, and Piety. Just got Mindcraft from FF w/ maximum multiplier. Gloat...

Spot check: 
<pre>AU 103098
HP 266
SP 23
Pt -1866
4 blows/round, 8-384 damage/round
50 unspent skill points
Still only 3 slime molds, btw.
</pre>
    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 I do some calculation, and if I burn all 50 skill points I can get Mindcraft up to 26.7. I intend to take it to at least 35 in order to get rpoison. 40 would get me Identify. I'll probably take it all the way to 50. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I put 43 skill points into Mindcraft, which takes me up to spell level 23 and enables me to cast Adrenaline Channeling. Boosting Mindcraft makes my total Mana=33...not much. Seven skill points left over, I might put some of those into Magic later to boost Mana. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Got Precog now, so I sell that staff of Sense Monsters that was so handy a short time ago. Maybe it will bring luck to someone else... 
</p>
</li>

<p>
Precog also senses traps, so I get rid of the staff of Sense hidden and the rod of stair/door location. 
</p>

    <li>
<p>
 Sell off from my last trek &amp; restock.

<p>
I decide to get the Lothlorien spider quest out of the way. It's one of the quests that I feel most comfortable with. I stay on coward/brisk, get a few extra CCW, and start it. Sorry this account is brief -- I was pretty busy -- but I did get a cmovie of the last part of it.

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Precog, stare &amp; memorize, duck into trees. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Kill off top part of area, rest for more mana, precog, target, go thru trees; dodge/kill/duck, kill first few areanas, then first elder areana. Then another elder takes me down to about half hp, but I kill it, dodge back into trees and rest. Precog tells me where the others are. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I find a good corner, and line up a number of elder areanas, areanas, and other spiders, and kill maybe 10 of them (including 2-3 elders) in a row. I find myself at 189/266 and dodge fully into the trees to heal up, then kill a bunch more. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 An Areana (or an Elder Areana?) finally starts summoning, and now there's a lot more beasties to dispose of. I try Mindwave and find out that spiders resist that. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I dodge in and out, come face to face with another elder and a few areanas, and get confused. Phase Spiders teleport me to the lower right hand corner of the map and I hurridly dodge into the trees, and rest there until I can see clearly and have my mana back. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The whole key is to come in on a diagonal so there is only LOS on one spider at a time, then dart back out to the trees to rest/heal if needed. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 [Time passes] Quest is done; I have the rest on cmovie but it's just more of the same. No more close calls. On my way out, I pick up an Areana skeleton (no elders dropped skeletons, darn it) in case I luck out and get Summoning later.

I spend a point each on barehand &amp; dodging. Then I blink. Two levels?! I doublecheck. Yes, CL32. Cool. But... I had 7 skill points leftover when I was CL30. I leveled, spent two points, and now I've got twelve, which means I had 15 before?!? Then I remember that I leveled during the spiders quest last night -- I was just too busy to note it down - it was after I stopped typing out the details. <p>
OK, Mayfair asked what my kit was. I was about to post a link, but (doh) with luck I'll be making many more updates to oook, so here we are. This is what I'm about to head to the Old Forest with: 
<pre>Equipment:
Light Crossbow 'Hirth'
Rings of Levitation and Invisibility
Amulet of Resistance
Feanorian Lamp
11 Bolts (hrm, getting low... I *do* use them occasionally)
Shovel
Carrying:
Junkart of remove fear/cure poison
40 CCW
15 Scrolls of Teleportation
5 WOR
50 ID
9 Satisfy Hunger
Wands of Manathrust and Noxious Cloud
Staff of Disarm
25 Empty Bottles
</pre>Now that I've got Mindcraft, I'll probably dispense with those wands eventually. The Manathrust one currently does 11d4 damage. Pulverize can do 12d8. But I don't have all *THAT* much mana yet (only 43) so the wands are backup. 
</p>
<p>
I doublecheck which level that death fate is on... 18, then it's time for the Old Forest, which spans levels 13 to 25, slightly deeper than the Orc Caves. Thunderlord-teleport to-

 Bullywug and Dark Elven warriors. Ho hum. Red Worm Masses, etc. I'm about to go down a stair when I decide to wander around a bit more. I often find really decent junkarts on these levels with so-so feelings. I'm not sure why that is.

 Precog shows a little group of Hill Orcs, a water streamer, a fountain, and a small grid pit (square, not rectangular.) I kill the orcs, enter another small room outside my detect zone, and... ack, a Priest! Fortunately it doesn't wake up and I get away.

 Another bunch of War Bears. FYI, they resist Mindwave (doh! they're stupid), but if you creep up right next to them while they're sleeping and cast it, it's a great way to wake them up and annoy them.

 More wandering (I won't bore you) turns up a Scroll of *Enchant Armor*. Oh, that's a *big* help! I save it to read on whatever armor I recall out with, to boost its sale price.

 A dark elven mage hits me with magic missile, then I kill him. (Btw, my saving through is, via 'coward', excellent.) He drops a Demonblade and a Wand of Fireflash[6|16].

 A Bronze Firebird joins the party, and helps me face down a dark elven warrior who *also* fires magic missile--this time I dodge it. Then it dies to a L10 Clear mushroom patch. Go figure. One nice thing about Precognition: I now have a (temporary) source of See Invisible.

 Speaking of which, I'm walking towards some stairs past a ring (rfire) I'd left on the ground and notice something pick it up. I precog, see a Poltergeist, and shoot it. Now if the RNG were kind, it would drop something great, but it's just +5 soft leather armor. O vell.

 Somewhat smaller level than normal. Some wandering shows probable cause of the feeling: a checkerboard pit. Contents: Stargazer, Green dragon fly, Dark hounds, Clear hounds, and assorted others. Dark hounds blind me, and I tree walk outside to heal up, then go back. Cake, and I net an Oil of Eagle. This really doesn't warrant an {excellent}, so I keep going. Some time later I find the true source: an Orc Pit, and right next to it a small room filled with novice rangers, and one Black Louse. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I head first for the Black louse - it's amidst the rangers. A Gold Firebird shows up and is quickly killed by a ranger. (That seems wrong, doesn't it? ) Even though I shift to 'running', the dang louse gets away from me -- it was too far away to start with and started multiplying in the trees. There's no way short of geno that I could get them all now, and I don't have geno. Blast. I turn around and dive into the orcs. (After I kill about 10, I remember to start praying again )

 I get hit by a spell from a shaman. In the loot, I find a potion of invisibility and quaff it, to stack with my RoI. This ceases all spell action (that I notice, anyway), but increases the 'milling around' factor, too. Much mayhem later, my piety is now -923, first time back up from under -1000.

More hounds: Light and Dark. A bit further along, more Energy hounds, mixed in with Cold hounds &amp; Wargs. I shouldn't have smirked last time, because now the E-hounds get me for a bit more damage, still no biggie though. I clear the room - there's a backtrail of Cold hounds down a corridor - and precog shows me a room FULL of war bears just beyond. I avoid them. They're easy to kill but irritatingly time consuming.

Beyond that: Yes, it's a pit. A slime pit. 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 There's one spot on the corner of a room where I can get the hounds to come at me one at a time. This works fine, though a couple of times I hit the '7' key a bit too enthusiastically and end up in the room itself, and have to backtrack rapidly. Ack! No sooner do I type this than I do it AGAIN, and this time an Earth hound fries the trees around me. There are too many hounds around me to pull a digging trick this time, Mindwave doesn't do enough, so I read a scroll of teleport at 254/284 hp + cuts. I land someplace safe and decide I don't want to kill the rest of those hounds anyway... 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I run into a pair of Sabre-tooth tigers. Again, I've never seen two of them in one place at the same time before. Then I fall over a novice paladin and accidentally kill it. -1092 Pt. Drat. - 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
==== Old Forest 21 / good: ===== 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 I'm hearing screaming and noise in the distance, but all I see via Precog is a Green dragon worm, which I kill, and further away, a pack of Earth hounds. Hm. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I wander - don't hear the noise anymore, it must be back on the west side of the map, when I see an interesting-looking '~' and check it out. Oops, can't be picked up, as it's a Hammerhead shark :blush: 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 BTW, nothing has hit me in quite a while other than by spell. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I see some Mirkwood Spiders (piety!) and move north up a waterway after them, when I blink in surprise. Well, there's the source of all the screaming. It's a vault, 34w x 18h. And my pack's full, figures! The waterway has sliced into the vault wall on the lower lefthand side, penetrating not only the exterior wall but the interior one as well. Precog shows nothing scary inside, but there are... *sigh* 18 novice paladins. The RNG hates me. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Other things inside: 6 snagas, a crow, a bullywug shaman, wererat, 13 Mirkwood spiders, a few scorpions, a mummified human, 6 clear hounds, etc etc.... and many traps. Out of all of those, the wererat and the traps worry me the most. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Most of the novice paladins are between the outer wall and the inner structure (which vaguely looks like a person lying on his side; I have a screenshot.) I move north past them as fast as I can, reach the interior structure, and duck inside. The wererat is right there and I kill it straight off. I accidentally kill a novice paladin and get docked 80 Pt. Sigh. I say to heck with it re: my piety when they block my way entirely. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Remember those scrolls of Enchant Armor? Now I get Enchant To-Dam. And a Magic Trap set... 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 A short while later, my piety is at -1880 and the remaining few novice paladins are chasing me in laps around the vault. If it wasn't so pitiful, it'd be hilarious. And I find nothing of interest, when all is said and done, but a Vampiric Dagger (1d4) (+5,+2) (-40%), a Ring of Accuracy (+16), and a Ring of Nether Resistance. The last isn't bad at all, but not worth it to my kit. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I'm about ready to go downstairs, but decide to check the rest of the level. I find something a bit odd: a vertical row of Firebird corpses, blue, brown and green. Plus 'Advanced Lessons of Numenorean.' Did I mention my pack is full?- 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<h5 id="head-49120aec13103902bddc5e8db90305c4ff949aed">Old Forest 22 / excellent:</h5>
Right next to me, a Jelly Pit. I explore a little, kill a bunch of gnome mages (Pt, fwiw), and- <h5 id="head-520e6d78681ea1a5c7324e10311103ee86c18e8b">Old Forest 23 / very good:</h5>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Precog shows a cluster of 14 dark elven warlocks, and a mini vault. Also, this is not a big level. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The warlocks yield a demonshield, a couple rod tips (illumination/etc), a potion of resistance (which I keep for the time being), staves of teleportation, sense hidden, and recovery (which I don't.) Earth hounds interrupt me mid loot-scrounging, and I kill them plus a fire vortex. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The next room yields a wand of Tidal Wave, which makes me happy. The ring of accuracy goes. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I get closer to the vault and am confused, but not by a monster. I precog the vault and there's only two traps and two monsters in there, one L2 and one L4! What gives? I'm saving a screenshot of this one, too. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I canNOT get into this darn vault. I've set to berserker/slug-like and dug like crazy, for a long time, at all the points I can think of, with no luck. I've dug so long a bunch of Air hounds/black orcs/etc autogenerate and come after me. I kill them and get back to work on this vault. I'm not sure why I'm bothering except that it's something of an enigma: Precog shows only two monsters inside -- a Large grey snake (L4) and a Giant black ant (L2) -- and two traps. What's up with that? And more to the point, are they standing on anything good? Rrrghhhh..... 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I give up on the darn vault -- grr -- and keep going. Another 2-headed hydra. Come one, 5 heads! In the midst of wiping out a sabre-tooth tiger, something breathes acid at me and fries all the trees along the corridor. I can go forward, back, or teleport away. I go forward. Acid and Air hounds, great. Except... in the scroll of my messages I see this line: 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
'It magically summons help!' 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Precog shows that in the immediate vicinity (did I mention that I REALLY like that visible monsters list?!?) there are: a rock mole, 9 ogres, a griffon, 20 air hounds, a quylthulg, 8 vampiric mists, and 12 elite uruks. Guess who did the summoning. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I'm past the burt out section of corridor and the acid hounds are dead, but I'm surrounded by air hounds who are in the corridor and the trees. The Q is dead ahead in a room with the orcs, and the ogres are in another room. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I realize I'm still stuck on berserker/sluglike and switch to running. I power through the Air hounds and get within a square of the Q when it blinks off someplace, but now the uruks wake. Now that I'm closer, vis monsters shows 14 uruks, not 12. For some reason there's a Master yeek in the same room as me and the uruks, but it's not showing up on the visible monster list. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Master yeek blinks away. The Elite uruks are mobbing me (220/284 - all arrow damage, I think) and I'm not really worried, but I start edging towards the side of the room. The Master yeek comes back and dies quickly, as do the others. No decent loot. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Precog shows those ogres have an ogre mage with them, plus a couple of archers and an energy vortex. I move through the trees to them, kill an ogre or two, get the vortex (I'd been aiming for the mage first) and then the mage. This turns out to be the room with the vampiric mists, btw, but soon everything is dead. Sifting through the loot turns up a Pebble (3d6), which IDs as Travak. I almost leave it sitting there, but I destroy a Book of Teleportation and take it with me... it'll make a good Mathom. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I think about heading for the stairs or WOR'ing, but take a quick turn about the level, and run into Bloodfang, the Wolf. A Dark elven mage near him drops a rod tip of light. I leave it there. A short distance away, however, I come across a Wand of Tidal Wave[4|23]. Ooooo. I'm already carrying a Tidal Wave wand, but not so good. I nuke a Potion of Resistance (I'll get more of those later) and take it with me. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 A bit further along I find a pit-type room (not full) with....cold hounds and rotting corpses? That's an odd combo. I turn on praying, though, and get to work. I wind up cut and stunned but a CCW takes care of that. Somewhere along the way my INT and CHA have been reduced. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I walk right into a pit-type room with ~15 Earth hounds in it, and the sad part is that I think I knew this, but its been a few hours since I'd played, and I forgot about it. Oops. They all die, and I wind up with a bad cut and 231/284. Not bad considering no rshards. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I find a Black potion under some rubble, and it turns out to be of Naivety. Darn. I often find great things under rubble... 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Another Master yeek and a couple of dark hounds and a harpy or so. Getting blinding by dark hounds is becoming tiresome. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I see an Umber Hulk (first one for this char, I think), am distracted by that and get sucked into a room with a big pile of Blink Dogs and Elite Uruks. I use a combination of Mindwave and Barehand, and don't get pogo'd around *too* much, as a result. Nothing interesting in the loot but an extra ring of levitation, which I leave behind. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I run into and kill a Great Eagle (first one I've *ever* seen) and then realize it's 'good'. Darnit. It drops a corpse and I consider taking it, but don't. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I'm not quite sure what happens next, but I wind up in a room with a whole bunch of undead and a few uruks, and quickly turn on praying. Crypt creeps are summoning more, too. I back down the corridor to limit the flow, and soon I'm up about 300 Pt to -1588. Yippee. In the same room, there's a handful of MH dragon worms. I kill them, then see something pick up a worm corpse and blink out. Precog shows two poltergeists in the trees. I let them be and check the loot. I've only two ID scrolls left. A pair of boots turns out to be +2 - oh well. Snake egg, staff of recovery, demonblade, cutlass, ring of rfire... yadda. Then, under yet another Amulet of Infravision (I've been finding scads of those!) I find and ID with my last scroll: A Shield of Deflection [10,+16]. I might as well sell that. I'm done with this level and pack is full, so-

    <li>
<p>
 Did I mention I found a Ring of flying under some rubble? The shield sells for ~8600. Vampiric dagger sells for 10k cap (I'm lazy.) Junkart does not sell and *ID*s for...summon pet??? That's the second one of those, and I've never seen that power before this character. Weird. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Out of curiosity, I get a quote on Travak: 793 AU. Heh. I was going to Mathom it, but my house is full, so I sell it. Assorted other sell/clean house/restock. Piety now at -1542. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I try to find a better digger, but the only Picks around are also (+1). Drat. I hate to do it, but I blow an inventory slot on the wand of Thrain. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I sleep at the Inn, but morning shows no new inventory that matters to me. I'm very low in ID scrolls (13) and a tetch low in CCW (34), but I can live with that. WOR -

<h5 id="head-48efa5d779db6ec2231f8dcb9b05326a9881f07f">Old Forest 23 / good:</h5>
I see another quylthulg (or however that's spelled) in the distance, but there's a down stairs only a few steps away, so- <h5 id="head-0c6430478eee5457830c330129ce21c6abadf766">Old Forest 24 / looks like any other level:</h5>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Small level - 4 sectors tall, one wide. Air hounds, quickly done with, and a Fountain of Sleep. I move out into a water streamer and run into...hello, 9 Aquatic Hounds, and a Globefish. In the distance there's a Bronze dragon worm. I try to backpedal, get hit by a water bolt and am stunned and confused. This is bad, even though my hp are 219/284. I'm now mobbed by Aquatic Hounds. Next move: 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 'The Aquatic golem wakes up.' The Globefish starts breathing gas. That's enough for me: I'm fine now, but there's way too much opportunity for YASD here. I chug a CCW to rid myself of confusion, and dive into the trees... 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 and emerge in a room with a stack of Forest trolls, Flying skulls, etc, which I hadn't precog'd. Piety! *Vroom* 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I finally find another Slime Mold. (Total to date: 4) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 There's a way to line up those Aquatic hounds and kill them one by one - a variant of a corner of the room trick, ducking back into the trees when I have to, to heal. Its that breath that hurts. I take them out, though. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I find a fountain of Heroism and fill just a few bottles. Might help me with Old Man Willow, who's on the next level down. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Take one step, fall over a Water naga (never have seen one of those, either) who drops an un-ID'd potion (restore WIS) and a few other things, and then I'm fighting Hill trolls who are slogging through the shallow water at me. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 There's a room partially sliced off by the water streamer that is half full of Mirkwood Spiders. Piety! *vroom* I head back into the water - there's another fountain out there in the middle - when I find myself surrounded by Sand mites. Darn. I hate these things. The fountain is of Corruption. I get out of the water and head for the stairs. 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<h5 id="head-3868d8379d9f80460819d05aeead18da45fd3534">Old Forest 25 / excellent:</h5>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Big ol' water room plus a bunch of corridors, slightly smaller than usual map. I get away from the water room to start, and check the corridors/rooms. Fountain of Stupidity. I find an un-ID'd rod tip, but I've only got 9 ID scrolls left. I'll wait to see if it pseudos first - its probably frost bolt or something. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Wandering around, I don't look where I'm going and trip... ooof. A Chaos Ball trap. It confuses me, drains life, makes me hallucinate, destroys a weapon in my inventory, and leaves me at 197/284. I stagger into the trees and heal up. My WIS is also drained (I'm not sure when that happened) but I find I'm also carrying a potion of restore wisdom, so I quaff that too. Nothing I can do about the lost 11k XP though The last few times I've been at the temple I'd thought about getting and carrying a few Potions of Restore Life Levels, but I didn't. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Continuing to wander, I look for Old Man Willow. I find and kill a Forest wight, first one I've seen. Then I run smack into Khim, son of Mim. He drops a light crossbow and a tulwar, I'll check them later. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I trip over a giant turtle, and then a green dragon worm. I really should precog more often. I precog, and see a checkerboard pit with a stack of hill trolls and a single hummerhorn. I try to sidestep it, but they all come piling out of the trees after it, including a bunch of hummerhorns. I run for it, and kill a fair percentage of them. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 More dragon worms, then a Red dragon bat. Where's the Old Man? A bit of Precog reveals a Vampiric ixitxachitl but no OMW. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Oops, there he is. I initially mistake him for a vampiric mist, try to run him over, then pause when he doesn't run over promptly. THAT is a record. I think that's the fastest I've ever, ever killed Old Man Willow. Let's see here. 22 blows kills him. I've probably killed him with fewer blows or bolts, but in elapsed time, this was darned fast. He missed me once, and never touched me. He drops.... Metal Brigandine Armor, a Long Bow, and Small Metal Shield. No jewelry, darn it! Armor = Resistance, Bow = Extra Shots, Shield = randart. I wander just a little more and sight-see at the Piranha pools, then WOR-

 Old Forest was boring, as I expected, except for those two vaults, though even they were not impressive. I had hoped for a better haul from the bigger one. Also, that digging issue was rather irritating. Must find a better digger.

 I now have rpoison (phew) and a temporary source of SI via Precognition. I still need rconf, rblind, and positive Piety would be a nice thing. Another god quest would be nice. And oh, how I would like a source of Reflection!

<p>
<strong>Next?</strong> Not sure, probably Lothlorien Old Mage quest, plus Land of Rhun (think: hydras!), Maze or Sandworm, and I'll probably duck back into Mirkwood as well. I'd love to get the Gondolin house, but not without rconf/rblind or at least until I've got a lot more mana or Magic Device under my belt. Symbiosis would be nice, too, even just a point or two for extra HP.

 I was planning on finishing the Land of Rhun before posting, but Notepad maxed out on me, and I had to use Wordpad to come to a good stopping place.

<em>Lothlorien:</em> No ID scrolls at all, and I need to clear out the house a bit. Some weapons to go to Gondolin for sale; rings, potions of speed, an Areana skeleton to go to Bree, etc. 
</p>
<p>
I dare the north route from Lothlorien to Gondolin for the first time. (Of course, I've left my shiny new Climbing Set at home, I forgot about it!) But I make it without incident. I've avoided it til now for fear of ambush; in my experience, ice fields seem to be more dangerous that way than other terrains, the same way deep water areas are. (I don't know if this is true.) 
</p>
<p>
<em>Gondolin:</em> 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Here I find my scrolls of ID. I buy the whole stack of 99; I'll stash the leftovers. I also buy out all 31 CCWs in town. The Dagger of Aman sells for 30k, sigh. Nothing good in the BM, and no decent bolts either. I rest for the night. More CCWs, IDs, a few Restore Life Level potions, a bunch of +0,+0 bolts (to be enchanted later and hopefully combined with those I'm carrying now.) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I swing by the BM and see something VERY interesting: A Feanorian Lamp of Boldness. I'm currently carrying a plain Feanorian Lamp, and lugging around a junkart of remove fear/cure poison. I just got a ring of poison resistance, so... I peer at it for a while. It costs a little over 50k AU, and I have 97k. I *really* don't want to buy it. I manage to steal it and breathe a huge sigh of relief. The new lamp doesn't give rfear, but a power of remove fear at a cost of 5 mana. I can live with that for now, though I'm not going to ditch the junkart right away, just in case. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The BM has a randart Sheaf Arrow (1d5) (+15,+1: acid, elec and frost damage, slay dragons, orcs, giants, demons, undead, *slay* natural creatures. I'm tempted, but I'm not giving up my crossbow for it!

Side trip to Bree: Dump stuff, find nothing good, head back to Lothlorien. On the way back down, I find and pop down the stairs to the Land of Rhun, then climb back out. Then I get a new fate, rah.

 All stocked up and nowhere to go. I consider doing the troll glad quest in Bree, but I do NOT want to accidentally run into that Ringwraith yet, so I wait. Hmm... I think I'll do Rhun, as fast as possible, just to get it out of the way. With any luck, I'll find a 5-headed hydra... Rhun covers DL 26-40, with Ulfang on the bottom.

    <li>
<p>
 Precog shows me a Ranger, a Paladin, and stack of Earth hounds. I move north, the panel changes, and I see in the distance....another vault. Good thing I have Thrain with me, huh? 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I outdistance the hounds and get to the vault. It's small to medium size: 40 wide by 15 high. As I'm circling the vault to see what's in there, the Earth hounds catch up with me and I kill them (and a pack of elite uruks) off. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The vault has an outer wall an an inner one, the inner one surrounds many various small rooms interconnected with doors. It has many hounds in it (light, dark and acid), a dark elven lord, clairvoyant, mindcrafter, young MHD, a 3-headed hydra (darn!), a louse, a grave wight, a Qulthulg, and a LOT of other stuff, including breeders and a pack of novice mages. I'm probably going to get blinded a lot if I'm not careful. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I pick a corner where a bunch of dark hounds have come into the outer corridor (the idea being I can pick them off first), cast Precog, and use Thrain to get in. I immediately get blinded, but due to Precog, I can actually still see. How cool is that? 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I can see where the traps are, and try to disarm one, but it goes off. If Slappy hadn't already been an "it", Slappy would be now. I work my way around the corridor to the doorway leading to the interior. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I fight my way inside - acid and dark hounds are at the forefront, along with the mindcrafter &amp; clairvoyant. I'm blind again but I can still see them. And then sometimes I really am blind - and I think my precog has worn off, but then I can see again even though I'm blind. This is weird. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 A pukelman takes a bit of killing, then I'm into the next room, chasing down army ants. Precog has worn off. I get into the next room, which is fairly large and with an open doorway leading directly into the room beyond, and cast Mindwave to good effect - a bunch of things die, most of which I can't see, but at least a few Phase spiders get it. With any luck, I'll get teleported past all the traps right into that next nest. (There's a big, 3-deep barrier of traps I'd just as soon bypass if I can.) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I pick up an unID'd potion, kill an army ant and a fire vortex, and sure enough, here I am with the Phase spiders &amp; others, and the Q is in sight, too. Mindwave kills many in the room, but the Q is immune, so I go straight for it. Or try to - I get teleported back along the way I came in by a room or so, but a few more mindwaves take care of that, and then I kill the Q before it can summon. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I'm into then novice mages (mixed in with assorted other creatures), get confused, chug a CCW, and keep going, using Barehand once my mana's down to 5. Soon everything immediately around me is dead and I hide around the door jamb to rest, killing anything that comes around the corner at me. Mana'd back up, I pare my pack down of all the {good} and {average} items, cast Precog, and look to see what's left: that louse (ergh), the young MHD, the hydra, lots of light hounds, and wide assortment of other things like war bears, hardened warriors, rock lizards, etc. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 First up is the hydra, which is easy. Light hounds, then the dragon (takes a number of hits, but it never hits me). I roll over the remaining beasties, I'm frantic now to get at that louse, which is in the most central room, though I've been closing doors behind me just in case. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I get there, kill few few that have multiplied, and I'm done. I start cleaning up loot, and an Inertia Ball trap whaps me HARD for half my hitpoints. Ouch. I don't think I'll try to disarm that one again. I manage to get back out without any serious problems (a trap or two of poison daggers is all.) I'm definitely getting better at disarming. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Loot: A trap set, a ring of extra attacks(-1) (oh well), INT potion, 2 potions of enlightenment, potion of resistance, 2 potions of curing, a wand of Firewall, staves of Fiery Shield and Identify, shield o' RC, and a cap of regeneration. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The potion of INT is nice, it gives me 8 more mana. I keep the other potions; the rest'll get sold. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I keep on going towards the far side of the map (cruising for anything interesting, esp. hydras), and see Ibun, Son of Mim. He drops a good weapon, and I go on. I do find another 3-headed hydra.

<p>
 I *was* going to WOR back out, but the level feeling has me curious. I wander the level looking for the explanation. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The answer: Another vault! This one has Sangahyando of Umbar in it, a huge slew of novice mindcrafters, hounds, a handful of young dragons, and other schtuff. Current monster count with precog is 83. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 This vault is wider than the last one, but not so tall. It's also open, and monster are coming out after me, mainly novice mindcrafters and hounds. A LOT of hounds. And many of them are cold hounds and they are breaking my CCWs... 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Sangahyando shows up; I trade blows with him, and he blanks my mind 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
I return the favor by offing him. After this, I get wound up in clearing the vault and don't record anything for a while, but nothing terribly interesting happens. I'm running low on ID and CCW. Something drains my experience (might have been a trap, or a wight), and I realize that along the way, the few potions of restore life levels I've been carrying have been destroyed, probably by those darn Cold hounds.

</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I restock. Wow, I've never tried really using Thrain before, and recharging it is pretty darned cool! There's not enough CCWs in town, though, and no Restore Life Levels, so I swing by Minas Anor.

<p>
<em>Minas Anor:</em> Nothing good at the BM. There are Restore Life Levels, but no CCWs. I quaff a RLL, return to CL32, and receive my second God quest, quite some way from my current position and northeast of Lothlorien. Yipee. I might as well go to Gondolin, then, instead of Bree.

 Well, I didn't see the quest entrance on the way, but I didn't really explore for it either.

 BM has a Mattock of Digging (+6), but I leave it be. I've got Thrain, and a Magical Mattock (or some such) will show up eventually.

 I find three, count'em, CCWs. Ugh. It's night, so I nap at the inn. Day brings 7 more, but that makes only 30, and I want more. I guess I get to go to Bree after all.

 On the way out, I recheck the BM &amp; find Potions of INT and Resistance. I buy both. The Potion of INT gives me 18/85, and 8 more spell points.

 I decide to find the quest entrance and pick up a few extra scrolls of Sat Hunger.

<em>Bree:</em> I would love to know what Slappy's luck is. She's now got ANOTHER death fate... on DL 1. Again it's night at Bree, and between night and the next morning, I'm up to 45 CCW. Back to Lothlorien.

 I beat on Ulwarth for a while and eventually kill him. He drops good double chain mail. He doesn't hurt me, but those blasted Cold hounds catch up and start breaking my CCWs. (Fortunately Ulwarth is dead by now, so he isn't healed by them.) I see Beorn through the trees and make for him - he's sleeping - and push past him to let HIM deal with the hounds... then dodge into a room in the trees and let Beorn take my back.

The shaman was right next to a building. I duck inside, close the door on the hounds side, and go out the other. (Yes, I could kill them too, but I would like to keep my potions/etc.)

 The hounds are still after me. I find a fountain of cure critical insanity and drain it. Precog and looking at the big map ('M') show me the probable cause of the level feeling: A jelly pit. Yecchh.

 I consider just going down again, but I might as well trawl for uniques and vaults and hydras.

<p>
 At first, all I manage to dredge up are hounds and assorteds. I'm soon trailing a tail of energy hounds that are trying to catch up with me when Beorn comes up on my visible list, and I see a baker's dozen of dark eleven warlocks in a clump. They quickly die to Mindwave, leaving a large swath of loot, mainly potions. The energy hounds use up the rest of my mana in Mindwave and I kill the last of them by hand. (I want them dead ASAP so as not to disturb the warlock loot.) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The haul from the warlocks is pretty good: Potions (one each) of INT, DEX, CHA, and Enlightenment, a junkart (Green Tome-&gt;Tenser's Alteration Manual), a staff of Fiery Shield, and a 0,0 Mage Staff. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I go find Beorn and wake him up. Slugabout, sleeping while I'm in a fight!!! Beorn *insists* on summoning Fire hounds anytime I run into a monster, which is worse than the monsters themselves. I repeatedly dismiss them and consider dismissing Beorn, too, but I'm a little superstitious aobut that, so I let him tag along. He pays me back a short while later by summoning a pack of multi-hued hounds. Yippee. A bit more wandering (pack is full, must ID/weed it), and I go down to-

 I land, cast Precog, and immediately notice this is a small level. The width of the map fits on my screen. There are dark hounds and elite eruks running around. A bunch of Mindwaves later there is loot to pick through: pebbles of slay undead, dwarven double chain mail, rings of rcold and sustain.

 Further along, a room full of novice mindcrafters. I plan to examine this level fairly carefully since there's usually a high density of dungeon trash.

<p>
 There's earth hounds, too :/ and lookee there, a big cluster of 21 uruks. Then mountain ogres, more hounds... and a pesky novice paladin I manage to scare but I can't charm it. Then a young green dragon. (And a whole bunch of other critters.)

 Eventually, I'm done. I've got another potion of resistance, a potion of death (which I lug along thinking to throw at someone, but I should probably use it fast, or destroy it, lest some cold hound blow it up while I'm carrying it ), rod tip of slow monster, a spectral lance, and some wands.

 A bit further down, a cluster of 24 Gnome mages, an evil eye and a hardened warrior off in another direction. I go after the gnome mages, who summon a few things (guardian naga, a giant beetle) and I get mostly through them before I realize I'm forgotten to pray again. Blast it all!

<p>
 I cast Character Armor because I *think* I remember Mim being a spell caster. (I don't bother checking.) Mim mostly gets beaten the heck up by me. I watch and for a long time see nothing but him getting struck and stunned. Then I see two misses by him, a dodge by me, and a little while later, he casts an acid ball at me. (Yup, I remebered correctly.) I'm fine at 277/284, while he's at '**'. Finally I see a message "Mim... flees in terror! Mim... is no longer stunned." I cast Pulverize at him, which dazes him, and he flees again, down to one '*'. He steps away from me, I catch up, and one more blow kills him. THEN I see I forgot to pray again. Rrrrrr... alright, that's it, I'm just leaving it on from now on.

 I go after the Crypt Thing. At first I'm doing just fine, then *WHAM* I get mind blasted for nearly half my Sanity (152/245), serious damage, blinding, and then it blinks away... thank goodness i'm carrying a potion of healing and a potion of cure serious insanity which I've found along the way... quaff them, then it blasts me AGAIN, blinded and confused, and down to Sn 110/245. This is not cool. I chug a couple CCWs and teleport away, then rest like crazy until I can see straight. No, wait, I'm still not seeing straight, but there are other beasties around here including hounds...not to mention which, I'll bet that Crypt Thing can teleport. Too much risk. I WOR out-

Then again, even with tactic set on 'coward' (giving an 'excellent' saving throw), that Crypt Thing was hitting me for big ol' chunks of Sanity. I might've ended up a vegetable, instead...and that would result in an extremely dead Slappy! *shrug*. Just to rationalize a bit: My pack was full anyway (And yes, I need more Spirituality...)

 I look at the scrolls of teleport in my inventory. I can't read them when I'm blind or confused. My mindcraft teleporting spells will work when I'm blind, but not when I'm confused.

 Smaller level, but larger than some. Precog shows Acid hounds coming toward me. I move northeast after them, losing a number of scrolls in the process. Now, in the distance, I see a group of Nexus hounds. At first I see only 4, then as I draw closer I see more and more (9 at least.) One of them breathes at me, and suddenly I'm on the far side of the map. 
</p>
</li>

 Precog shows a bunch of buildings. Two, halfway out of view on the map, look like pits or special rooms, and one of them is almost certainly an orc pit. A few more steps... yup, the one to the west is an orc pit. The other is a special room with a Dark elven lord in a tiny room at the center. A bunch of clear hounds are headed for me, and there's a Paladin I'm hoping to avoid. Piety now -12, but the orc pit should take care of that very nicely. I start on the hounds (cake), then notice the orcs are awake and headed straight for me out of the room. I switch to coward/running (from coward/brisk) and start in on it. I use a Mindwave or two, then hold off until I can get a clear LOS at most of the pit itself before I cast it again, depending on Barehand, which is doing well.

 The Paladin finally catches up with me as I'm sorting through loot, and that wand of Teleport Away comes in handy. I go over to the other special room, and on the approach, I trip a Trap of Drop Everything. Gahhh. Well, at least it wasn't Scatter Everything! The Dark elven lord drops nothing interesting, and I keep going. I consider going on downstairs, but I've left a big chunk unexplored in the middle of the map, so I keep going.

 Well, lookee there! A 5-headed hydra. It wakes and heads right for me. I kill it... and it doesn't leave a corpse . 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 To make up for this insult, a Mage drops a junkart (Large Crystal Ball-&gt;The Crystal Ball of The Witch-Kingo of Angmar), and a potion of DEX. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I see the Paladin trying to catch up with me, keep going, and run into those Nexus Hounds again. I'm promptly back across the map by the empty Orc Pit again. Feh-

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Smallish level. My pack's full again. Let's see here... 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 What was that someone was saying about a very small vault with two traps in the bottom? I think that's what I'm seeing via Precog. As I'm sussing it out, a Dark elven priest comes up. He drops a potion of Charisma, which puts Slappy at 18/10. Ain't Slappy pretty, even though she's an it? 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 OK, the vault. The monster in the top half is a Giant fruit fly. Feh. I figure out where to enter the main vault, then where to enter the interior part. Fortunately, part of my loot is a staff of disarm, so the two unknown traps are easy work. Meanwhile, of course, the fruit fly is now 5 fruit flies. I get into that chamber, kill them easily (I'm still running, so +11 speed), and find a Feathers Cloak [1]. It IDs as a Feathers Cloak of Protection [1,+15], which is delightful, but I can't use it 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 There's a special room nearby that telepathy shows has a Mature white dragon inside. That's the first mature dragon I've seen outside of Angband wilderness. I stop by another room on the way to investigate a fountain, and find it holds Cure critical insanity. I'd be happier if it were Cure insanity, but... I destroy a Long Sword of Slay Demon, and stock up. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 On the way to the dragon, I kill a Ninja (first I've seen) who drops a Venomous Cleaver. I'm about to head in when a bunch of White Wolves appear, and I decide to clean them out. In the process, I enter another room and discover (much to my happiness) a Parchment - Numenorian for Beginners (I). Some of you might care less about this, but I use the "ure nimir" inscription all the time for my characters, as none of them (so far) have the Globe of Light spell, and I don't like wasting a slot on a Rod of Illumination. (Enlightenment... something else.) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 OK, the mature white dragon is an easy kill. It drops..(ok, I'll give you the whole list, just this once ) rings of searching (cursed twice), spell, (pause for ID) strength(+2), plain jane Chain Mail and a cursed light crossbow and longbow. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I take a swing around the level and Precog for anything interesting. I see a yellow tilde and think at first it might be a junkart or a trap, but closer inspection shows it to be an Undead stargazer. Killed with no problem whatsoever, but just as a reminder to everyone: Look out for the water in swampy levels! 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 A bit further: A Mystic. It never hits me (I dodge once), and it dies. It drops...drum roll, please... a wand of dig[1|1]. In the nearby surrounds, a big pack of light hounds, and a bigger pack of phase spiders. Feh. I cast Minor Displacement and create a jumpgate inside of a nearby room, then go north. The light hounds follow. (I'm not worried about them, I just don't want to have to waste time on them.) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Precog from my new location to the north shows a Revenant, a Blue dragon bat (I've been killing a lot of dragon bats, btw), and two rooms with fountains in them. Minor Displacement again.... 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 It fails; I think I picked a location too far away. I kill the dragon bat and walk to the room: Resist Cold in the fountain, a waste of my time. I head up to the next room... 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 WHOA! A lot happens, very fast. I thought I'd had Precog casted here. Here's the message history: 
</p>
</li>

    </ul><pre>(pack overflows, I drop pot of rcold)
The Light hound breathes light.
It magically summons its kin.
The Phantom tries to blank your mind.
Your memories fade away.
The Spectre misses you. &lt;2x&gt;
The Phantom tries to blank your mind.
Your memories fade away.
The Ghost missed you. &lt;3x&gt;
</pre>Visible monster list shows a Phantom Beast, Ghost, Spectre, Dread, Phandom, and a Novice Possessor (soul) along with the light hound pack. What the heck happened? My detect invisible must have worn off... 
    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 I cast Precog and then Mindwave. A previously unseen Experienced possessor (soul) collapses, along with the novice one and the Ghost. The Phantom Beast is immune. The Dread and Phantom aren't happy at all, and the Phantom blanks my mind again. My HP's fine (down 2 points). 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Oh - I'm standing in a room doorway, but they are after me three abreast since they don't care about doors. I Precog *again* (lest something else sneak up on me) and kill the Dread with Barehand, dodging repeatedly. The Spectre and Phantom are both trying to kill me, and my mind keeps getting blanked. I go after the Dread and kill it. I should have gone for the Phantom, since now it blasts my mind and I'm down to 211/252 Sanity and confused. A CCW helps with the confusion, and soon after I see, in the message recall, that I'm resisting at least some of these mind attacks, not to mention dodging like crazy. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 This time I target the Phantom. It dies... and then (literally) 10 seconds later, they are all dead. Of course, now the Light Hounds are piling in, but I'm not impressed. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The potions of Cure Critical Insanity potions I'm lugging around come in handy, and soon I'm back to normal. The loot is garbage, though, and I'm a bit disappointed about that. (Wand of ice storm 2|30, stave of fiery shield 3|10, essences, and a monstrous compendium.) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I continue across the level, eventually finding a Young blue dragon who terrifies me before I kill it. Later, I'm moving through the corridor around a special room and run into a streamer of Araneas. They are filtering down into the corridor from a room just a square to the north; there's 13 in all according to the visible monsters list. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 One casts a fire bolt, another incants at me. I'm at 200/285. I try to cast Adrenaline Channeling, and fail. I just keep going. I'm down well below 200 hp (they're still casting at me) when I remember I have a potion of healing in my pack, and that heals me completely. Seconds later, they are all dead, and I'm at Pt 608 (Yes, this is pitiful, but it's better than -3000!) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I'm back approximately where I started by now (by that mini vault) and go down to- 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<h5 id="head-1cfbd11156e83e40a623eedde062a83801fed1bb">Land of Rhun 36 / strangely lucky:</h5>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Smallish level. Good thing, my pack is (well, has been) full. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I move south (I landed in the northwest corner) and see a checkerboard room just north and adjacent to a checkerboard pit. In the area: Snagas, a bunch of Water trolls and Ologs, a Shardstorm (erk), Cloud giant, Wererat (must find it), a Cloud giant, etc. These seem to be in the pit and in a room nearby. Even further south is an Illusionist and an orc pack of at least 20, hanging out in the forest. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I move north, take out a couple of Ologs, and find another cluster of previously undetected Snagas even further north. I clean them out, then circle back south again. I'll fiddle with the loot later, as I've only 18 ID scrolls left. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Next stop: the checkerboard pit. The wererat is in there, and I get it (the screen was dark enough I didn't see the dark grey 'r' until I was hitting it). The Illusionist comes up behind me from the forest while I'm finishing off the wererat and Ologs, and regrets it. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Next: The room with the Water Trolls. Turns out there is also a Bodak and a Skeleton ettin in here. (Gee, my Piety's at 1077 after that! ) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 By now that nest of orcs way down to the south of me has filtered up and started attacking. Black orcs and Uruks. I mindwave a bunch of them, then I'm out of mana. Not to worry, killing them by hand just takes longer. I follow them down through the trees (there's a *huge* swath of loot behind me by now) and I see what I think are more Ologs and go after them. Unfortunately, the window that I'm now typing in is covering over the visible monsters list, andit's not til I'm halfway through them that I realize the 'O's are actually Merrows, including a Merrow mage, priest, and a Spectral Merrow. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 After the dust finally settles, I wander around wondering what to ID. I come across a Potion of CHA. Then a scroll of Prot Evil. I peer at my pack for a few moments and ditch my restore life level potions for the scroll. I don't bother ID'ing anything but bolts and jewelry, and find nothing interesting. (Anything else would just be AU.) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Now in the southeast corner of the map, I see a big pack of acid hounds coming at me and don't feel like bothering. A gold firebird is there, too. I teleport and wind up (somewhat to my surprise) exactly where I wanted to be: the northeast corner, where I haven't been yet. Moving west, the firebird catches up with me, as do the hounds...and the firebird soon dies. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Despite my +11 speed, I see an 'e' coming at me surprisingly quickly: A Gauth. It dies without hurting me. The Acid hounds coming up behind me do a bit better. I keep going. I see the 2nd Sandworm I've seen in Rhun, and kill it. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I hate Blink dogs. They disrupt me a bit, but I get where I'm going: a mature blue dragon. (2nd mature dragon seen...) No good drops. Some good dodging between rooms etc and I get away from my pursuers. I explore a bit further, and then consider going down. Nah, I'll recall first -- almost no ID if I find something good next level down. WOR- 
</p>

 I sell the wand of manathrust 4|19 I've been lugging around, as I don't think I've used it once. I also sell a ring of slaying(+10,+5) I found someplace.

Recap: Barrow Downs, 1st God Quest, Orc Caves, Lothlorien spider quest, and Old Forest are done. Partway down Mirkwood. Most of the way down The Land of Rhun; currently adventuring in Rhun. Received the 2nd God Quest but haven't found the entrance yet. Have houses in Bree and Lothlorien; residing in Lothlorien. <p>
I need (amongst other things) rconf, rblind. I have a temporary source of SI, and I have remove fear, though not rfear. I would love to get a source of Reflection, as just about the only things that are hitting me now are spells. Granted, not all of them are bolts, but it would sure help. So would more Spirituality (for a better saving throw) but I'd rather get as much as possible via the God quests. 
</p>
<p>
My Piety has FINALLY gone into the black, but is still quite low. 
</p>
<p>
Oh yes, and I now have two Death Fates: DL1 and DL18. And it occurs to me that, since I've just received my 2nd God quest, I don't know what level I'll be entering in on. I don't THINK it will necessarily contain DL18 (seems more likely for god quest #3) but it's a tetch worrisome.

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 It's a little irritating when I get a decent feeling when I come back to a DL I've been on before. OK, once around the park, as it were. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Precog and 'M' show a foursquare special room and a smallish level, respectively. The special room is fairly close by. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The special room has a pile of novice rogues, an illusionist, a Clairvoyant, 12 Fire hounds, 5 Vibration hounds (well, I've already killed one), a White Wraith, pack o' snagas, some assorteds, a young bronze dragon, and Ulfast, Son of Ulfang. There's also a shrieker in there with the snagas and the casters. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Barehand and Mindwave make quick work of the hounds. The dragon and wraith are in the same little room right next to each other, and to my surprise, I manage to kill the dragon before the wraith ever wakes up. I didn't realize my stealth was quite that good; I guess being a card-holding Coward does help 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Illusionist and Clairvoyant come out of the next room, first. I step in, Mindwave, and the snagas are dead. Then I kill the shroom. Then I start cursing because once more, I've forgotten to pray. RRrggghhh.... (I start praying.) Oh, and I've also picked up a new junkart, the infamous "something weird", aka Kelek's Practical Joke. I've only found it once before. (Junkarts never activate for the same thing twice, from game to game, unless by chance, but last time I found it it was worthless.) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Umm.... where did the Ologs and the Mezzodaemon come from??? Answer: the botttom of the visible map, which the special room is almost on top of. Must remember to check those.... I recast Precog, and although I can only see a handful of monsters on the current visible map, the "visible monsters list" now suddenly has 56 monsters, including Shadowfax, steed of Gandalf, a Demonologist (eek!), a Revenant, Mindflayers, a Nexus Q, Black puddings, cave trolls, gargoyles, a pile of manes and war bears and a bunch of other stuff. Hrrmm... 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I use the 'L' commands to shift the visible map about a bit, and see another foursquare special room immediately south of the one I'm in... Well, that explains it. And now Draebor, the Imp pops up on my list as well. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Mezzodaemon is on top of me immediately, straight through the walls. I *think* it came from the room to the south. It misses me four times. With barehand, I hit it twelve times (and miss once), and kill it, no damage to me. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Soon after, Ulfast goes down to only four blows. You know, I keep meaning to write something a little dramatic like "And with one last circle kick, Ulfast sinks to the floor".... but the message immediately preceeding opponent death is almost always something like "You demolish/cripple the {whatever it is}." or "You wound Ulfast, Son of Ulfang." 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Top special room is done, so I head to the southern one. The Demonologist and Draebor are what worry me the most. I cast Precog again (telepathy just expired) and see that the Demonologist is lurking just *outside* the room area, just outside of a Mindflayer. I decide to go for those first, though there's a whole slew of manes etc along the northern "racetrack" corridor around the room who are trying unsuccessfully to get my attention. I think that's Shadowfax to the east of them (haven't checked), but I won't worry about him now. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I kill the Mindflayer while the Demonologist helpfully summons an Erinyes right next to me. I cast Adrenaline Channeling and set explore to 'running'; my speed is now +20. The E goes first, then the Mindflayer. Then I turn my attention to the Demonologist. There's a bunch of Cave trolls trying (unsuccessfully) to hit my back, and I ignore them for now. I kill the Demonologist without it hitting me or summoning anything else, for which I am profoundly grateful. (Other chars of mind have had levelled Demonologist companions, so I know how dangerous they can be. The one I just punched into paste wasn't levelled, of course, but I was still concerned.) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I pause to Recog again. Yup, that's Shadowfax alright, but I can't find Draebor anywhere. Is he invisible to Precog? Or maybe off the map, or... well, I'll find him. Meanwhile, a few Mindwaves wipes out war bears and a bunch of other critters, and here comes Shadowfax. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I've 26 mana left right now, and I debate casting Mindwave or renewing Adrenaline Channeling. I decide on the latter, as Shadowfax is pretty quick--three blows (missed) to my one. I fail to cast it, and Shadowfax misses me three more times. Now I don't have enough mana to try it again... just enough to cast one Mindwave, and I keep it in reserve just in case. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Urgh... a LOT of blows later (mostly missed on both sides, though I stun him a number of times), I see: "You feel yourself slow down." This means I was still hasted, earlier, from the first time I casted Adren. Channeling. Assorted observations: a) I wasted the mana trying to cast it again, blast it all! b) Shadowfax is now even more fast. c) Shadowfax is still at *******. I hang on to my mana, and switch to my crossbow and those lovely bolts of acid I found a while ago. Four bolts later, the nice horsey is at ****. I take it from there with Barehand. A LOT of blows later, Shadowfax goes to Horsey Heaven. (Actually, I really hate killing Shadowfax; he's one of my more favorites in the books.) After all that melee, I'm down to only 266/285. Not too shabby! 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I've been leaning on the right arrow button, and the next thing I see is: 
</p>
</li>

    </ul><pre>You found a trap!
Gas sprouts out... you feel you transmute.
You identified the trap as Trap of Femininity.
</pre>Yay, Slappy is an Abbess again, not an... Abbitt? 
    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 I clear out the southwest room and rest up to full HP and Mana, then go looking for Draebor. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Next room: The Mindflayer, black puddings and revenants. I take out the Revenant and start in on the Mindflayer when it blasts my sanity down to 139/236 (blinding and confusing me at the same time.) I quaff a CCW, see a Chthonian miss me and nearly have a heart attack (remember, I've played Z...) then laugh at myself. I activate my junkart of cure insanity, which brings me to 191/236, so its description lies! I manage to kill off the remainder of beasties in the room, then close the door and rest until *finally* I can see clearly again. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The last (northeast) room holds a Nexus Q, a plain Q, a Death Sword, and a couple others. (Still no Draebor?) The Nexus Q disappears almost instantly, and I think my INT and WIS have been swapped. A single bolt each kills the other two. By now, my junkart of cure insanity has recharged, so I get sane again finally. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Draebor must have teleported off somewhere. I go looking for him. On the way, I find a room stuffed with Bats of Gorgoroth (blah) and Lemures. Once done with that, I find a Potion of WIS on the floor. A bit further, I find a fountain of cure insanity. I drain it despite having the junkart. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 A ways further, I run into another pack of ~ 20 Dark elven warlocks. I'm standing inside a room, they are streaming towards the open doorway. A couple of Mindwaves take out a few, then I cast Adren Channeling. That gets me to the doorway (through a number of them). That lets me have clear LOS on the rest (including a skeleton one.) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Lots o' loot left over. I find a Parchment - Advanced Lessons of Numenorean. I can't remember if I've found that one or not - have to check my own posts but I read it anyway. Then I find an Orange Tome-&gt;Gamenlon's Summoning Manual. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Still can't find Draebor, then I run into a small pack of Multi-hued hounds. Casting Major Displacement takes me back to the double room area, and I catch sight of that Nexus Q again. I sneak up on it <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/idea.png" alt="(!)" height="15" width="15"> and kill it. I bypass a Fire Giant (too far away), move due north and... well, here's Draebor, off by himself in the trees. How odd. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I'm at full HP/mana, so cast Adren.Chann again. Then I pause to think, and cast Character Armor as well. (At this point, it gives me extra racid/fire/cold.) *Right* after I do this, Draebor summons 20 Gargolyles, a Tengu, and a Death quasit in one go. One Mindwave hurts them all (the quasit jumps away) but now I have almost no mana left. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Now the Death quasit chimes in and summons 6 Vrocks. I've got plenty of HP (281/295) left, but this is not going well. Did I mention I'm completely mobbed? I use the wand of noxious cloud -- it affects the Vrocks, the others resist. (I was curious) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I'm about to use controlled teleport to get out of the mob when I realize I'm standing right next to Draebor. I switch to berserker/running (the berserker part is probably dangerous, but I want the extra melee bonuses). I'm making fairly good headway when that little Tengu I was ignoring teleports me quite some ways away. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I find what I think is a safe place to rest up, near a building. A Spectre come through the wall at me; I kill it and it drops a potion of CON (finally!). Then a Master Vampire comes at me through the trees. Despite being confused, I kill it. It drops yet another junkart (a Black Gem-&gt;The Gem of Hate.) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I move north, find yet another special room (room inside a racetrack) and Precog is now showing Lorgan, Chief of the Easterlings. What does that make, 4 uniques on this level?! In the distance I see a Vrock, which means I'm probably getting close to where I left Draebor. Drat. Killing Lorgan takes rather a while, and in the process I take a step north and the visible map changes to show 19 Energy hounds napping *just* north of the room I'm in, the Vrock, an Ogre priest and mage, etc. Lorgan drops some nice Sheaf arrows of Venom and a small sword of slay orc. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I see more ogres to the north and wander that way...then find myself pincered between a group of them an a Mature black dragon. I pay attention to the dragon, first, but there's a Cave ogre Mage in the mix, so I turn about and kill it first, then the dragon. In the process I take a step east, and now Lokkak, the Ogre Chieftain becomes visible through the trees. Make that five uniques! 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I maneuver a bit until I can see as many of the ogres as possible (now down to 12) plus Lokkak, and Mindwave. Repeatedly. Finally I'm down to 4 mana, many of the ogres are dead, and I barehand Lokkak...for a while...until he cries for the Gendarmes and gives up the ghost. 
</p>
</li>

 Turns out there's another Ogre mage, plus a lot more ogres hiding in the trees. They aren't so hard to get rid of, and I just start to rest when those Energy hounds decide to wake up. Drat. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Searching the loot turns up an Amulet of Regeneration and nothing else that interests me. (My ID scrolls are running low, so I don't ID any weapons or armor.) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I move northeast, and see the Draebor/et al. group again. I kill the Death quasit, then Mindwave the Tengu (hurting others), barehand a few Vrocks to death, then try Mindwave one more time.... and lose it, it backfires. A big pile of loot is destroyed and I faint with the effort and become paralyzed. Draebor walks up and kicks me a few times, saying, "Don't try running away, because you're the one I'll find..." Now here is the interesting thing: I'm paralyzed. He misses me three times, and then, though still paralyzed, I dodge him. Apparently he doesn't like this, as he teleports me away, straight into the middle of a wolf pack. Here is direct copy of what happens next, I'll type it out as I think it's interesting (I'll save a dump, too): 
</p>

 In other words, if those hadn't been wolves or something similarly low level, Slappy would most likely be pushing up daisies right now. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Once I can fight again, the remaining wolves are toast. I *really* want Draebor, but I'm standing within about 5 squares of a down-staircase, so I take the hint. <strong>very good</strong> feeling, indeed!!!

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 I'm planning on recalling right out, but I decide to roam just a tetch. I'm dodging Fire hounds (laziness) and some wolves, and read a WOR, when Precog catches a small vault in the distance. I read another WOR to cancel the first. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Nastiest inside the vault is an Elder Areana. I cast Adren-Chann, use Thrain to break through, kill a scruffy hobbit, then beat up (for a short while) on Elder Areana. It heals itself completely once, but soon succumbs. I've only lost 7 HP. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I kill off a Gorgimera, and that's the last of any fight inside the mini-vault. Across the top of the interior box, there's a bunch of 1x1 rooms (maybe 4-5?) that I have to dig through. Only keeper is a staff of healing. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 I roam a bit more, but this is a happily quiet level, so I WOR out with a sigh of relief. 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<h5 id="head-1df3a221d576f88a753eb802683fa2569bac1c8c-17">Lothlorien:</h5>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 I sell a few things, then start in on the junkarts. Kelek's practical joke sells; it activates for gain corruption. The Gem of Hate *IDs* for Death, and Gamenlon's Summoning Manual *IDs* for high stat loss. What a waste! The Sheaf arrows sell for a tidy 25460 AU - not bad for a store capped at 10k. (I'm always amused when it works out that way.) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Time to clear out the house again and move stockpiles of potions to Bree. 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
(Intermission while restocking; the BM at Bree will persist in taunting me with randarts I can't use! But I do buy a Potion of DEX. More AC, yay!) 
</p>
<h5 id="head-1de6d795bbca90bacfa557d5d034f83ef511cf7c">Land of Rhun 37 / looks like any other level:</h5>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Precog shows... a Lich (first I've seen), pack of Algroths headed by two Algroth priests, and a bunch of Halfling slingers, the latter two of which this character hasn't met before. The Lich dies easily, as do the others. (I had forgotten halfling slingers are evil; piety ka-ching! ) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Dread, Revenant....Druid, couple o' Mages, pack of Energy hounds, then a young MHD. Nothing exciting. A Necromancer drops a Potion of DEX. 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<h5 id="head-9cd4d54bec357987052311cf46c47800a162182a">Land of Rhun 38 / superb:</h5>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 There's a pit of... what the heck is that? Looks like an Amphibian pit, first one I've ever seen. It's way at the edge of the screen, monsters I can see are frogs, salamanders, greater basilisk, etc. Weird. Closer to me, a clump of Mongbats (ick) and some wolves, and an odd looking room that is either just an odd room or a small vault. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 There's a yellow 'I' that's probably a Hummerhorn or some such in the trees, and I decide to kill it off before tackling  the vault, though I'm a bit leery of the Basilisks (turns out there's more than one.) I take a few steps... 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
<strong>'"Eeek!"</strong>' 
</p>
<p>
I'm not even sure exactly how it happened, but a Greater Basilisk got out of the pit. In a bare instant, she was blind, and then she was very, very dead. Somewhere down there in Rhun there's now a very nice little stone statue of Slappy. 
</p>
<p>
Sorry folks, I thought I'd at *least* get her to the bottom of Mirkwood and into Mordor before she bought the farm, but it just goes to show how the dumbest and unpredictable of things can kill you. 
</p>
<p>
I'm gonna go play with my Assassin for a while, til I get the bleahs out of my system. Thanks for all the feedback, it was a heck of a lot of fun!

<a href="./ReenenLaurie">ReenenLaurie</a>: Note: I just copied and pasted the maylith posts so you can read it all at once.  If you guys want to do it in another way, well, I just thought I'd get it started. Other: I did some quick revamping on some of the <tt>=====</tt> type stuff and some of the <tt>------</tt> because they are formatting in wiki, so it's not very neat.  For those who want to 'neaten' it up, go ahead.
