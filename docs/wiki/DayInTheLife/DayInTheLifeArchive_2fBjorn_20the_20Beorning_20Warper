<p>
Okay, so maybe a Yeek Hermit Sorceror wasn't the best choice for my first DitL.  Of my remaining characters, Bjorn is pretty hardy, and probably the best choice story-wise; my style pretty much requires a character with a distinctive personality, after all. 
</p>
<p>
"And what <em>exactly</em> are you implying, lad? <em>(zizz)</em>" 
</p>
<p>
Shoo, go &#8216;way, you're not in this one&#8230; <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  Anyway, Bjorn definitely has a personality I can work with, and it's a sufficiently different strategy to be non-redundant with anyone else's DitL's, I think. Besides, I figured I'd better write him up sooner rather than later, before 2.2.7 comes out and obviates this entire character strategy.  So, I temporarily "retired" <a class="external" href="./www.killerbunnies.org/angband/ladder/bear/bear_1.html"><img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">my current Bjorn</a> and started <a class="external" href="./www.killerbunnies.org/angband/ladder/bear/bear_2.html"><img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">a fresh one</a> for this story. 
</p>
<p>
And so, without further ado, I give you Bjorn, the Beorning Warper, a fairly recent addition to my stable, inspired by <a class="external" href="./angband.oook.cz/ladder-show.php?id=2205"><img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">this Ladder entry</a>. Say hello to the nice people, Bjorn. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, dudes and dudettes.  Check it out, I just scored this totally excellent new job." 
</p>
<p>
Well, it's always good to see this kind of enthusiasm in a starting adventurer. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, who knew you could get paid to go surfing&#8230; uh, what do you mean, like, 'adventurer'?" 
</p>
<p>
Um, what do you mean, "surfing"? 
</p>
<p>
"That's what it says on my character sheet, right under my name: 'Beorning Surfer'." 
</p>
<p>
<em>[slaps forehead]</em> That's Warper, not "surfer". 
</p>
<p>
"Huh?" <em>[re-reads]</em> "Dude, you're right.  What's a Warper?" 
</p>
<p>
It's a subclass of Mage that specializes in the Divination, Conveyance and Temporal schools. 
</p>
<p>
"So, no surfing?" 
</p>
<p>
&#8216;Fraid not. 
</p>
<p>
"Aw, man, that's bogus.  Wait, adventurer?  That means I'm supposed to go off that lame-o loser spaz Morgoth, right?" 
</p>
<p>
Eventually, yes. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa, intense.  Hmm, Mage, right?  So do I get all those way cool, like, blow-stuff-up spells that Sorcerors get?" 
</p>
<p>
Not really, no. 
</p>
<p>
"Then, like, how am I supposed to fight stuff?" 
</p>
<p>
We'll be using Bearform combat.  That <em>is</em> why I went with a Beorning, after all. 
</p>
<p>
"Uh, dude, have you <em>seen</em> me in bear form?  Even the worms are like, 'Yo, right lane, slowpoke!'" 
</p>
<p>
And that's why I went with the Warper class, to compensate for that. 
</p>
<p>
"Don't see how; sounds like Warpers get all the lame spells&#8230; wait, you said Temporal, right?" 
</p>
<p>
Mm-hmm. 
</p>
<p>
"Isn't there a Temporal spell that, like, makes you go fast?" 
</p>
<p>
Yes, the Essence of Speed spell. 
</p>
<p>
"Hmm&#8230; bear form makes you go slow&#8230; but the spell makes you go fast&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
You can actually <em>hear</em> the gears grinding in his head, folks&#8230; <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
"&#8230;Yeah, we can totally make this work!  Hey, &#8216;least Grampa Beorn can't call me a lazy brainless slacker any more, huh?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, he certainly can't call you a lazy slacker&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"Isn't that what I said, dude?" 
</p>
<p>
Ummm&#8230; yeah.  Anyway, as before, here are the technical details: maximize and preserve modes on, and point-based stat allocation, netting stats 14/19/12/10/11/6; no non-main monsters, 49 quests, and worshipping Manwe for the eventual speed boost. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, this Manwe god dude, is he cool or, like, uptight?" 
</p>
<p>
He's okay eventually, but you're going to have low piety early on. 
</p>
<p>
"Ooh, sounds heinous." 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, them's the proverbial breaks.  Oh, here's my skill point allocation plan, as generated by my <a class="external" href="./www.killerbunnies.org/angband/tome-skiller.pl"><img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">tome-skiller script</a> (and as always, We Apologize for the Shameless Plug&#8482; <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> ):

</pre>Basically, the plan is to max Bearform-combat, Temporal and Spell-power, push Conveyance high enough to get Recall and Divination high enough to get Greater Identify, pick up a couple low-level utility spells (most notably Charm to handle good monsters without getting my piety wrecked), and dump the rest into Prayer.  For ranged attacks, my current plan is to use Manathrust and Noxious Cloud (from Manwe), as boosted by Spell-power&#8212;though I might go with Archery instead if I can get it from Mr. F. Fingers. 
</p>
<p>
Since I got a favorable response to it last time, I'll be posting in small segments, a few levels at a time&#8212;even though with this character, I <em>can</em> do lots of levels in a sitting (in fact, I got as far as Orc 20 with this character over the weekend, in just two sittings).  This also takes some pressure off me, since I can accumulate several segments worth of story in a sitting.

<h4 id="head-ce365581956ea70fd3fa611a8834b881e92ee712">Part 1 of 3</h4>
<p>
My normal pre-Thieves-quest shopping involves a lantern and oil; this time, however, I invest all my money in 5!oCLW. 
</p>
<p>
"Why?" 
</p>
<p>
You'll see.  And now, down the rabbit hole to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Thieves Quest</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<em>You feel a vicious blow to your head.</em> 
</p>
<p>
<em>[some time later]</em> 
</p>
<p>
"Ouch." <em>[rubs head]</em> "You could'a warned me about that part, dude." 
</p>
<p>
Sorry. 
</p>
<p>
"Okay, so how do I, like, cast this Essential Speed spell?" 
</p>
<p>
Um, you don't, not yet.  You need skill level 15 in Temporal first. 
</p>
<p>
"What?!  Uh, dude, you could'a warned me about <em>that</em>, too&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
I thought you knew. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, great.  So now what?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, for the first ten clvls, we'll have to make do with setting Explor to 'running'.  We'll still be slower than normal speed, but it's the best we can do for now. 
</p>
<p>
"Not excellent.  So, like, where's my stuff?" 
</p>
<p>
Down the hall, to the east. 
</p>
<p>
"All right, let's do this, then." 
</p>
<p>
My thoughts exactly.  I pick up my stuff, and proceed to the door&#8211; 
</p>
<p>
<em>*BANG*</em> "Halt, you evil-doers!  Surrender now and return your ill-gotten spoils, or, like, I will transform into a powerful bear and smite you righteously and stuff!" 
</p>
<p>
After a moment's stunned silence, the room erupts in laughter.  "Hey, who let the genius out of his cell?" 
</p>
<p>
"Doesn't matter."  A Bandit emerges from one of the side rooms, licking the blade of his dagger and grinning evilly.  "He's seen too much.  Get rid of him." 
</p>
<p>
"So be it, then.  <em>By the power of the sons of Beorn, I HAVE THE POWER!</em>" <em>[flashy transformation F/X]</em> <em>*ROAAAR!*</em> 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/redface.png" alt=":o" height="15" width="15"> <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  I'm sorry, folks; I think he actually <em>believes</em> he has to shout that to make the change. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, I'm not stupid, dude.  I just figured I should, like, make a really dramatic entrance.  You know, mess with their heads and stuff." 
</p>
<p>
Riiiight&#8230;  Actually, I exercised a bit of literary license there, since bear form doesn't actually become available until <em>clvl 2</em>&#8212;which I achieve in short order by killing the first two Novice rogues with my Dagger on berzerker/running.  The next two are a few squares back, but I'm going to need a couple turns to set up, so I back up into the dark area before changing to bear form and putting all 5 skill points into Bearform-combat. 
</p>
<p>
I have just enough time to switch my melee style to Bearform combat and start praying to Manwe (which I forgot earlier&#8230;) before the next Novice rogue gets next to me.  He falls gratifyingly quickly, and the next one is a few squares behind him, so I take the opportunity to top off my hit points with a !oCLW before smacking him down.  (That's why I bought the !oCLW's, BTW; at speed -1, I can't run away, so I have to heal on the run.) 
</p>
<p>
In the main room, I use my last 5 mana pumping Manathrusts into the Bandit before he and another Novice rogue catch up to me.  They die quickly, taking me to <em>clvl 5</em> between them; I allocate the 15 skill points 3 to Bearform-combat, 2 to Fire (for Globe of Light), 2 to Mind (for Charm), 1 to Conveyance (which gets me Phase Door), and 7 to Divination (which gets me Identify). 
</p>
<p>
The rest of the quest proceeds without incident, and I return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
where I notice that I forgot to stop praying to Manwe, thus probably negating by now any benefit it might have had during the quest. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15">  The Bandit's dagger turns out to be (+5,+4).  I restock and proceed to: 
</p>

<p>
<strong>BDw 1</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"What a boring place&#8230;"  I'll say.  I barely even had to change to bear form; the residual one Bearform combat hit in non-bear form was enough (together with the occasional Manathrust for Fruit bats and Floating eyes). Maybe we'll have better luck on: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDw 2:</strong>  Princess quest for 14 Novice mindcrafters 
</p>
<p>
"You have a superb feeling about this level." <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/alert.png" alt="/!\" height="15" width="15">  That <em>can't</em> be just from the Novice mindcrafters, can it?

Nothing of note happens for a while.  A Green worm mass pushes me over the top to <em>clvl 6</em>, and I allocate skill points 1 to Bearform-combat and 4 to Temporal. 
</p>
<p>
I find the quest room on the southwest corner of the level.  The Novice mindcrafters fall quickly; only one even manages to get a fear spell in before I smack him down.  Between them, they push me to <em>clvl 8</em>; the 10 skill points go 2 to Bearform-combat, 6 to Temporal, and 2 to Conveyance (which gets me Disarm).  The princess offers me a Lance, a Lance (from the Dept. of Redundancy Dept.), and Rhino Hide Armor.  Hmm, the armor could be useful, but I need to be hoarding money to buy my first Essence of Speed spellbook.  I go with the second Lance, which, according to one of my accumulated Scrolls of Identify, is&#8230; wait for it&#8230; a Lance of Westernesse  (+4,+4) (+2). <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/alert.png" alt="/!\" height="15" width="15">  That'll certainly cover my shopping needs for a while. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15">  I finish off the level, just in case there's anything else superb on it (there isn't, that I can find), and then scurry back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Hmm, the Bree weapon store is capped at 10Kgp; a whirlwind inter-city tour finds 25Kgp caps at Gondolin and Lothlorien and another 10Kgp cap at Minas Anor.  Back to Gondolin, then, to sell the Lance.  I also buy a Spellbook of Charm from the magic shop before returning to Bree, where I buy a Wand of Dig and a Spellbook of Noxious Cloud (the latter stowed for future use). That taken care of, we return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDw 2</strong>, take 2 
</p>
<p>
"Looks like any other level&#8230;" <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15">  My piety is -634, and I'm only 8xp from the next level; and sure enough, a Blue jelly pushes me over the top to <em>clvl 9</em>, with skill points going 1 to Bearform-combat, 1 to Temporal, and 3 to Divination (attempting to get see invisible out of Sense Hidden, in anticipation of the first relic quest&#8212;which I just now realized I haven't gotten yet&#8230; <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15"> ) 
</p>
<p>
The rest of the level proceeds without incident; we continue to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDw 3</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"This level can't be all bad&#8230;"  This turns out to be a 3x1 small level (screens from [0,0] to [0,2]), and passes quickly and without event. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, this is boring." 
</p>
<p>
Oh, I'm sure it'll be more exciting on: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDw 4:</strong>  Fumblefingers quest for 9 Novice warriors 
</p>
<p>
Or maybe not&#8230; <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15">  "What a boring place&#8230;"  I tend to agree.  The level proceeds very boringly; at the end, Mr. F. Fingers offers me a choice of Magic, Archery, Symbiosis or Necromancy.  Hmm, I know I said I wanted Archery, but I could <em>really</em> use some more mana&#8230; Magic it is, then. My inventory is full of stuff to be ID'd, so after finishing off the level without further incident, I return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Annoyingly, a Cutlass that I sold unidentified turned out to be enchanted. 
</p>
<p>
"So why didn't you identify it, dude?  I thought you said we could, like, cast the Identify spell now." 
</p>
<p>
We could, if I could find a Spellbook of Identify for sale somewhere. Sounds like it's time for another shopping tour.  Before heading out, though, I buy a Potion of Charisma from the Bree Black Market, just for giggles, which takes me from 6 CHR to 8. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/attention.png" alt="<!>" height="15" width="15"> <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
The Gondolin Black Market has another Potion of Charisma, which takes me to 10 CHR. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15"> <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15">  No spellbook of Identify, though. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15">  Lothlorien has nothing useful; in Minas Anor I buy a Spellbook of Disarm and an Amulet of Slow Digestion.  Back to Bree, hoping for a hail-mary pass&#8230; and it's a lateral one:  no Spellbook of Identify, but the book store does have a Spellbook of Essence of Speed, which I'm going to be needing soon. 
</p>
<p>
On that positive note, we restock and return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDw 4</strong>, take 2 
</p>
<p>
"What a boring place&#8230;"  I've been getting a lot of these lately.  I'm only 5xp from the next level, and sure enough, a Creeping copper coins pushes me over the top to <em>clvl 10</em>; I allocate skill points 1 to Bearform-combat, 1 to Temporal, 2 to Divination and 1 to Conveyance.  My speed in bear form (plus running) drops to -3&#8212;but it'll only be for this level&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
Nothing else of note happens on the level, other than a Giant white lice infestion near the southwest corner. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15">  Oh, and I charm my first good monster (a Novice paladin)&#8212;which reminds me, my piety is down to -1598&#8230; <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/sad.png" alt=":(" height="15" width="15">  Maybe we'll have better luck on:

<p>
<strong>BDw 6:</strong> Fumblefingers quest for 20 Baby white dragons 
</p>
<p>
"What a boring place&#8230;"  No, this time I disagree; this time, all the important monsters will be coming to me. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  The fourth dragon takes me to the all-important <em>clvl 11</em>&#8212;and to commemorate this seminal event, Manwe <em>finally</em> gives me the first relic quest, southeast of Bree and northeast of Minas Anor.  The temple dungeon, then, will be dlvls 7 thru 11, and the monsters will be level 14 at the top and 22 at the bottom.   
</p>
<p>
"Whoa, that sounds harsh, dude." 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, and we don't even have see invisible yet; I think we'll do some more of the Downs before taking that on.  Oh yeah, I allocate skill points 1 to Bearform-combat, 1 to Temporal, 1 to Divination, and 2 to Conveyance. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, Temporal's up to 15 now; that means we can, like, cast the speed spell, right?" 
</p>
<p>
Yep.  Wanna take it for a spin? 
</p>
<p>
"You know it, dude!  Hang on!  <em>By the power of Whats-his-name, ACCELERATE!</em>" 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/alert.png" alt="/!\" height="15" width="15"> I'm not even going there&#8230;  With Essence of Speed up and Explor set to running, my speed in bear form is +3. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile2.png" alt="B)" height="15" width="15">  Annoyingly, its duration is rather short, and it's fairly expensive in mana and has an annoyingly high fail rate.  Oh well, it's a start. 
</p>
<p>
It improves slightly with the acquisition of <em>clvl 12</em> shortly thereafter from the twelfth Baby white dragon.  I allocate skill points 1 to Bearform-combat, 1 to Temporal and 3 to Spell-power, which pushes Essense of Speed up to spell effect level 3.  Hmm, I'll need to get it to 5 to go any faster, but this does buy me a few extra turns duration and a slightly lower failure rate. 
</p>
<p>
The last dragon takes me to within 22xp of the next level, and Mr. F. Fingers offers me Thaumaturgy, Necromancy, Magic-Device or Monster-lore. Well, <em>that's</em> an utterly useless set of choices&#8230; <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  I take Magic-Device as the least useless.  By the time I finish the level, I'm up to <em>clvl 13</em>, with skill points going 1 to Bearform-combat and 4 to Spell-power. 
</p>
<p>
Annoyingly, my pack is full again; back, then, to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
I ID (by selling) my first Potion of Cure Light Insanity, to start my stockpile.  Still no Spellbook of Identify in the stores, and a shopping tour gives no joy&#8212;though it does net me a fate to find a Potion of Water on dlvl 18. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude!  What kind of a bogus fate is that?" 
</p>
<p>
The kind that symbolizes the uselessness of the shopping tour, I suppose&#8230; <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15">  I go ahead and pick up a Spellbook of Recall for future use, and then return to:

<p>
<strong>BDw 6</strong>, take 2 
</p>
<p>
"What a boring place&#8230;"  I manage to slightly offset my precipitously descending mana (now -2348) with a few Snotlings and Snagas; otherwise, fast-forward to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDw 7</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You like the look of this place&#8230;"  Now things are getting a bit more interesting.  Just a few moves in, Sense Monsters detects Wormtongue in a checkerboard pit.  This will take a bit of preparation&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
I lure Wormtongue out of the pit (eating a Noxious Cloud from him in the process) and Phase Door to an adjacent room.  From here there's a wall between us, so that I have fallback in case Essence of Speed fails. Luckily, it doesn't, and I lure him around the corner next to me.  One turn takes him down 5 stars, and he misses this turn thanks to my speed advantage; next turn I take him down to 1 star, and he steals some money and teleports away, just to spite me. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/tongue.png" alt=":-?" height="15" width="15">  I'm not worried, though; by now he's bleeding badly enough that it only takes him a few turns to die. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15"> Now I just have to find where he died&#8230; <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
A pack of Snagas takes me to <em>clvl 14</em>; I allocate skill points 1 to Bearform-combat, 1 to Temporal, and 3 to Spell-power.  That pushes Essence of Speed up to spell effect level 7, which means my running speed in bear form is now +4 and the fail rate is noticeably lower. 
</p>
<p>
I end up having to search almost the entire level before finding Wormtongue's drop: 30 Bolts.  Hmm, this could go for a lot of cash; let's go find out: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Wormtongue's drop turns out to be 30 Bolts of Flame (+1,+5), and goes for 16080gp.  <em>Still</em> no Spellbook of Identify in the stores, and no luck in the shopping tour&#8212;but this time the hail-mary pass takes, and the Bree book store has one in stock as I come back. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15">  I also pick up a Spellbook of Reveal Ways&#8212;not strictly necessary, but at berzerker/running, my Searching is atrocious. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, this is an awful lot of books to carry around&#8230;" 
</p>

Yes, Mages are often faced with that problem in the early game.  At least you're fairly strong for a Mage; imagine if you were, say, a Yeek&#8230;

"You like the look of this place&#8230;"  Nothing much interesting at first, other than some Manes allowing me to desperately claw my piety back from the brink.  Then I run into Mughash near the center of the level.  Oddly, he's wandering around completely alone; according to Sense Monsters, his entire entourage (all Large Kobolds) is asleep in the next room.  A poor choice on his part, I think&#8230; <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15">

<em>[slaps forehead]</em> Just kill him, already.

"Dude, don't rush me, I'm getting to that." 
</p>
<p>
<img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15"> Mughash falls in two turns, and his entourage is not much more trouble.  They push me over the top to <em>clvl 15</em>, and I allocate skill points 1 to Bearform-combat, 1 to Temporal, and 3 to Spell-power.  My unhasted speed in bear form is now down to -8, but with Essence of Speed now up to spell effect level 9, my full speed (with running) stays at +4. Hmm, Sense Hidden is also up to spell effect level 15, gaining the see invisible power. 
</p>
<p>
"Does that mean we can, like, go do the Manwe god dude quest thing now?" 
</p>
<p>
Probably, but I want to do at least the next princess quest level first. Now, let's go see what Mughash dropped&#8230; a Frozen Lucerne Hammer (+1,+2) and a Spear (+2,+4).  Not bad.  His entourage didn't drop anything of interest.  The rest of the level is uneventful, and we proceed to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDw 8:</strong> Princess quest for 12 Novice possessors (soul) 
</p>
<p>
"You feel strangely lucky&#8230;"  Sheesh, talk about anti-climactic. 
</p>
<p>
"Why?  What are they?" 
</p>
<p>
The disembodied spirits of Possessors trying to find a body to possess. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa!  Dude, they can't, like, possess <em>my</em> body, can they?" 
</p>
<p>
No, they can only possess dead bodies.  And since they have no attacks and only one hit point, it's unlikely they'll be able to kill you. 
</p>
<p>
"<em>*whew</em> &#8230;Wait, bogosity check; how do a bunch of wimpy ghost things like that capture a princess?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, I would assume they were just left to guard her, actually. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah?  And who leaves a bunch of wimpy ghost things to guard a prisoner instead of, like, big strong Ogres or something?" 
</p>
<p>
Beats me, let's just go rescue her.  Since there's twelve of them, the quest room will be the lake form.  We're entering on the northeast corner of the level, and luckily, they're not very far in&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"No, brave warrior, we have never met.  I am certain I would remember a warrior as brave and&#8230; um, ursine as yourself." 
</p>
<p>
"But, Princess Lady," <em>*swat*</em> "I've already, like, rescued you once, from those Novice mental cases." <em>*rake*</em> 
</p>
<p>
"No, I&#8211; oh, now I understand your confusion.  Princess Clarice of Castle Cagliostro was recently rescued from similar captivity six levels above us; I am Princess Zoot of Castle Augh.  Are you the same brave warrior who rescued Clarice?  Then I am truly fortunate." 
</p>
<p>
"But, like, you look just like her!" <em>*maul*</em> 
</p>
<p>
"Yes, that is a mysterious and ill-understood phenomenon that is said to have puzzled scholars for centuries.  A wise sage once told me that it is called the Officer Jenny Effect, due to its appearance in the animated television series Pok&#8211;" 
</p>
<p>
Um, excuse me, Your Highness, but if you continue that line of discussion much further, you're going to get me in trouble for trademark infringement. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh!  My apologies, gracious Narrator.  Ah, thank you, brave warrior, you have slain my captors and freed me from my captivity.  As a reward, you may choose one of these three powerful magical items as a gift." 
</p>
<p>
"(Yeah, just like that other princess lady who wasn't you.  Like, what a coincidence.)  Hmm, what do you think, dude?" 
</p>
<p>
Well, the choices are a Beaked Axe, Flight Arrows, and a Lucerne Hammer. We can't use any of them, and the Flight Arrows will probably sell for the most. 
</p>
<p>
"Good call, dude.  Very well, then, Madam Princess Lady, I humbly accept your gracious gift of Flight Arrows with much gratitudosity." 
</p>
<p>
"So be it, brave warrior; I leave them here for you."  The princess vanishes in a puff of logic, muttering, "'Gratitudosity?'  Sheesh, adventurers these days&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, you don't think she was pulling my leg with that whole 'Officer Jenny' thing, do you?" 
</p>
<p>
I've pretty much given up trying to figure out the princess quest, Bjorn. The arrows turn out to be 27 Flight Arrows of Flame (+5,+4).  I don't think I'll bother with the rest of the level; instead we rest up, then proceed to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>BDw 9</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"This level can't be all bad&#8230;"  Ack, I forgot to stop praying to Manwe again; my piety is down to -2817. 
</p>
<p>
"Man, this Manwe god dude sounds like a major hardnose." 
</p>
<p>
Don't worry, he gets better further on.  And here's some Snotlings to beat up on to get back on his good side.

<strong>BDw 10:</strong> Princess quest for 6 Stegocentipedes

<p>
"You feel your luck is turning."  Hmm, Stegocentipedes are fast, but six of them means they're in the reduced-'X' quest room, so with luck I'll be able to fight them on my own terms.  I enter near the center of the south edge of the level. 
</p>
<p>
Nothing much of note for a while; a Skeleton human takes me to <em>clvl 16</em>, with skill points going 1 to Bearform-combat, 1 to Temporal, and 3 to Spell-power.

</p>
<p>
"Dude, I'm telling you, it's the same princess lady!" 
</p>
<p>
Just let it go, Bjorn&#8230;  The quest reward choices are Hard Studded Leather, a Ball-and-Chain, and a Dagger.  Hmm, the weapons would sell for more, but the armor might actually be useful&#8230; what do you think, Bjorn? 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, don't look at me, dude." 
</p>
<p>
Well, you're a big help.  I think I'll try my luck with the armor&#8212;which turns out to be Hard Studded Leather of Resist Acid [+6]. 
</p>
<p>
"Don't learn, do you, my boy? <em>(zizz)</em>"

<p>
Scat!  Sheesh, camera hogs&#8230;

<p>
<em>*groan*</em> Anyway, on that note, I take it back up to:

<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
I'm not bad off for money anyway; the various loot I've accumulated brings me to 46964gp after restocking.  Hmm, I could use a fresh Wand of Dig, though; Bree doesn't have any, so I swing by Gondolin, which doesn't have any either&#8230; <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15">  Well, I don't think I'll have to worry about that too much in the relic quest.

<h3 id="head-5f804428c5f0fd9e7baf842a8efaa02d91e26049">CHAPTER 2:  We're Not Worthy!  We're Not Worthy!</h3>
<p>
As mentioned in the last chapter, we're now headed out to find the relic quest temple. 
</p>
<p>
"Find it?  Didn't Manwe god dude, like, tell us where it is?" 
</p>
<p>
Roughly.  According to his message, it's "a very long way to the south-east of Bree, and a long way to the north-east of Minas Anor".  That's a lot of ground to cover. 
</p>
<p>
"Bogus, dude.  He couldn't, like, give us a roadmap or something?" 
</p>
<p>
<em>(shrug)</em> The ways of the gods are mysterious.  Fortunately, it only takes about a day or so game time to find; it's not far east of Mirkwood Forest, about midway between Erebor and the Sacred Land of Mountains.  In we go: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LTm -7</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You like the look of this place&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa, dude!  We're, like, inside a cloud!  Totally intense!" 
</p>
<p>
Yep, that's how Manwe's temples work.  Now, keep your eyes peeled; we're going to have search every square inch of this level looking for the relic. And you'll need to keep the temporary see invisible from Sense Hidden up pretty much full time. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, I can see all the ghosts and stuff.  Is this place, like, haunted or something?" 
</p>
<p>
No, invisible monsters are just fairly common in Manwe temples.  We might even run into&#8211; 
</p>
<p>
<em>Smeagol touches you.  Your purse feels lighter.</em> 
</p>
<p>
"Wha&#8211;?  Hey, come back here, you&#8230; you deformed munchkin, you!" 
</p>
<p>
Hmm, Smeagol leveled up to level 14 could be tough; we might just punt on him.  Let's keep looking for the relic for now. 
</p>
<p>
"But, like, he took our money!" 
</p>
<p>
We still have plenty left.  Let's just focus on what we're here for. 
</p>
<p>
<em>(shrugs)</em> "&#8216;Kay." <em>[some time later]</em> "Dude, there he is again! Let's get him!" 
</p>
<p>
Yes, now that we have a chance to prepare, we'll try taking him.  I restart Essence of Speed; on a hunch, I also set Tactic back down to normal from berzerker to get my AC back to normal, so that he's less likely to get away from me by hitting to steal.  Actually, the battle goes much better than I expected; Smeagol never even tries to hit me, and between my six bear attacks per round, some Manathrusts to soften him up, and some bleeding on his part, he falls in just a few rounds. 
</p>
<p>
"Man, what a wimp.  You had me worried there, dude." 
</p>
<p>
Besides his ring, Smeagol dropped a Dagger of *Slay Orc* (+6,+1) (+2). That finishes this level (one last quick paranoid sweep to be sure), and we need to restock; we're going to need a <em>lot</em> more Potions of Heroism at this rate, and I'm down to one charge on the Wand of Dig.  We recall, then, to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wilderness</strong> 
</p>
<p>
and spend most of the next day returning to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>

Hmm, now that I've got Smeagol's ring, I can go do the Mushroom quest.

"Dude, check out some of these mushrooms this hobbit farmer guy's growing. I'm <em>definitely</em> gonna have to come back and see if I can, like, score some more of these."

I think I'll wear wear that for the infravision boost.  After a quick side trip to Gondolin to sell off Smeagol's dagger, my gold is up to 61029gp. A bit of restocking, and we recall back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>LTM -7</strong>, take 2 
</p>
<p>
"What a boring place&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, haven't we, like, searched this level already?" 
</p>
<p>
Yes, but the relic placement check is done each time the level is generated, so we have to search it again. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa.  Totally heinous, dude." 
</p>
<p>
As you say. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, what does this relic thing look like, anwyay?" 
</p>
<p>
Like a purple '<tt>R</tt>' with a circle around it.  <em>[Editor's note:  That's after some char/attr tweaking on my part.  By default, the relic looks like a purple tilde in ASCII mode.]</em> 
</p>
<p>
"You mean like that thing over there?" 
</p>
<p>
Hey, that <em>is</em> the relic, just a few rooms in.  Good catch, Bjorn. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, this wasn't near as hard as you made it sound." 
</p>
<p>
We got lucky.  The next one will be worse, believe me.  Well, with the quest reward, my Prayer skill is up to 2.5; another one of these and I'll be able to cast Noxious Cloud. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa, righteous!  Maybe this Manwe god dude isn't so bad after all." 
</p>
<p>
Indeed.  Our job here done, we recall back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
We need very little restocking, as we were rather overstocked for the relic quest anyway.  Next time, the Orc Cave&#8230; 
</p>
<h3 id="head-b9b2a474f6108f434e2c72c3969ebdba7aa0bbb9">CHAPTER 3:  It Is Totally Dark; A Grue Could, Like, Eat You And Stuff</h3>
<h4 id="head-ce365581956ea70fd3fa611a8834b881e92ee712-2">Part 1 of 3</h4>
<p>
As mentioned in our last chapter, this time we're headed for the Orc Cave. 
</p>
<p>
"Ew, a whole cave full of Orcs?  Sounds totally grody, dude." 
</p>
<p>
Well, yes, but there are lots of evil monsters there, and Manwe likes it when we kill evil monsters. 
</p>
<p>
"He does?  Dude, what a coincidence!  <em>I</em> like it when we kill evil monsters, too!  Man, this Manwe god dude rocks!" 
</p>
<p>
That's the spirit.  Off we go, then, to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 10</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"This level can't be all bad&#8230;"  And there's our first batch of orcs, in a northern alcove of the rather large cavern into which we entered. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, let's get &#8216;em.  Halt, you&#8211;!" 
</p>
<p>
Um, there's going to be lots of orcs in this dungeon; I could do without the shouting for every batch of &#8216;em&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"Oh.  Sorry, dude." 
</p>
<p>
The orcs (a mix of Hill orcs and Snagas) push us over the top to <em>clvl 17</em>; I allocate skill points 1 to Bearform-combat, 1 to Temporal, and 3 to Spell-power.  Essence of Speed is now at spell effect level 12, and my top speed in bear form is +6. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
A little further in, I run into Brodda, who falls in three turns and drops a Small Metal Shield [+6] and a Dagger (+5,+2).  Enh, I'd wear the shield, except I don't have a shield slot in bear form.  A Dark elven mage behind him drops a Book of Teleportation, which could be useful in the future; I'll take it home and stow it. 
</p>
<p>
Near the end of the level, I encounter Vort and company. 
</p>
<p>
"Hey, isn't that, like, Mrs. Mughash?  Dude, she's gonna be pissed that I killed her husband." 
</p>
<p>
I don't think she'll have time to be mad, frankly; she flees after one turn and bleeds to death a few turns later.  The Large kobold Captain behind her lasted longer than that&#8230; <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15">  She dropped Rhino Hide Armor [+5] and a Light Crossbow (+2,+3).  Well, at least the armor's better than what you're wearing.  Again, her entourage managed to do better; one of the Large kobolds dropped a War Hammer of Slay Troll (+5,+5). 
</p>
<p>
A pack of Snagas further north drops a Shocking Main Gauche of *Slay Troll* (+4,+4) (+1).  Hmm, I'm getting pretty weighted down here; I'll prob'ly have to head back after the next level.  Speaking of which: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 11</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"This level can't be all bad&#8230;"  Not much of interest nearby, beyond some Crypt creeps off to the north.  Oh, I should probably note that I've started using the normal/running settings instead of berzerker/running; with six attacks per round now, I think I'm doing enough damage anyway that the extra boost isn't worth the AC penalty. 
</p>
<p>
A pack of Wolves gets me to <em>clvl 18</em>; I allocate skill points 1 to Bearform-combat, 1 to Temporal and 3 to Spell-power.  Beyond that and finding my first two Rings of Spell, though, nothing interesting happens. As promised then, I recall back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wilderness</strong> 
</p>
<p>
and proceed east to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Gondolin</strong> 
</p>
<p>
to sell off the weapons, bringing me up to 93572gp.  Back in: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
I restock and stow the Book of Teleportation.  The book store has a Spellbook of Manwe's Blessing, which I'll be able to use once I get my piety above sea level; I buy it and stow it for future use.  I copy Essence of Speed and Identify onto the Rings of Spell to lighten the load a bit. Then back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 11</strong>, take 2 
</p>
<p>
"This level can't be all bad&#8230;"  Indeed it can't; I find my first dungeon stat potion (of Constitution) practically right next to me as I enter the level, taking me from 12 CON to 14. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
Not much interesting for a while.  A pack of Cave orcs takes me to <em>clvl 19</em>; I allocate skill points 1 to Temporal and 4 to Spell-power. Essence of Speed is up to spell effect level 15, which makes my top speed in bear form +7, and the fail rate is down to 5%, which I probably can't improve without boosting my INT. 
</p>
<p>
The rest of the level proceeds without incident, and we continue to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 12</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"This level can't be all bad&#8230;"  The level is a 3x3 small level, and is thus over quickly, and without incident.  Onward to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 13</strong> 
</p>
<p>
I enter in a corridor, right next to a pack of Snotlings neatly lined up for me. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15">  There are more Snotlings further down the corridor, and Ogres behind them, which push me over the top to <em>clvl 20</em>; I allocate skill points 1 to Bearform-combat, 1 to Temporal, and 3 to Spell-power.  My unhasted speed in bear form is down to -9, but with Essence of Speed increasing to spell effect level 18, my top speed is still +7. 
</p>
<p>
Nothing much of interest happens after that, beyond finding my first three <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/idea.png" alt="(!)" height="15" width="15"> Amulets of Spell.  My piety is finally starting to come under some control, though; it's up to -3360 from down below -3600.  And on that positive note, we continue to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 14</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"This level can't be all bad&#8230;"  A nice crowd of orcs and ogres in the entry cavern on which to work out my frustrations&#8230; <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15">  They take me to <em>clvl 21</em>, with skill points going 1 to Bearform-combat, 1 to Temporal, and 3 to Spell-power.  I now have 7 blows per round in bear form, and with Essence of Speed up to spell effect level 20, my top speed in bear form is now +8.  And as an extra bonus, Identify is finally up to spell effect level 17, gaining the id-pack effect. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
The aforementioned hordes drop, among other junk, a Fiery Flail (+8,+8) and an Everburning Torch, which I snag for possible future use.  Lots more orcs and ogres on the level to keep my piety climbing&#8212;-3093 and rising. And I think I've finally achieved sustainability:  I can now regenerate the full mana cost of Essence of Speed before it wears off. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15">  It still doesn't quite make it if I have to cast any other spells, of course, and some of my utility spells are getting a bit expensive (10 mana for Sense Monsters?  Bleh&#8230;), but still, it's another positive note on which to proceed to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 15</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a good feeling&#8230;"  That's what I just said, isn't it? <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> There's a Priest near me as I enter the level, and it takes two tries to charm it.  That spell may not be useful for much longer. 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, if these priests and paladins and stuff are supposed to be the goodguys, then, like, why are they attacking us?" 
</p>
<p>
<em>(shrug)</em> Don't ask me.  In the next cavern to the north, a pack of Snagas drops a Ring of Fear Resistance.  Hmm, that would be handy, but I'd have to swap out one of the Rings of Spell.  I'll take it back up and stow it for possible future use.  Ah, Sense Monsters detects Boldor and company in a nearby cavern off to the east. 
</p>
<p>
"Whoa, check it out, the king of the micro-dudes!  Halt, you very small evildoer!" 
</p>
<p>
<em>[slaps forehead]</em> <em>Any</em>-way, Boldor falls in two turns and pushes me over the top to <em>clvl 22</em>; I allocate skill points 1 to Bearform-combat, 1 to Temporal and 3 to Spell-power.  Boldor dropped a Scimitar (+6,+1), a Katana (+3,+4), and Soft Leather Armor of Resistance [+15]. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/attention.png" alt="<!>" height="15" width="15">  I think I'll wear that one for a while&#8230; <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
A bit more exploring reveals that the level is a 1x5 small level.  I'm currently at the north end; at the south end, a pack of Snotlings drops a Spectral War Hammer of Slay Undead (+9,+9).  Hmm, this is getting to be a bit of a load; I think I'll recall back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
I stow the four Amulets of Spell (oh, did I mention I picked up another one on Orc 14?), the Ring of Fear Resistance and the Everburning Torch, and head to Gondolin to sell off the weapons, bringing me up to 121740gp.  I also *ID* a junkart that Boldor's gang dropped: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Gem of Ice, activates for death 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
<img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/alert.png" alt="/!\" height="15" width="15"> <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
"Dude, who would make a magic thing that, like, kills you if you use it?" 
</p>
<p>
Someone with a very, <em>very</em> sick sense of humor.  Back in Bree, the Black Market has a quite nice item in stock: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Ring 'Galon' (+11) (+4), with +4 STR, INT, WIS and searching,  sustain WIS, and resist acid and blindness 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
<img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/alert.png" alt="/!\" height="15" width="15"> <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> It's apparently built on a Ring of Damage, so the +11 is to damage.  I'd have preferred a to-hit bonus with this character, but still, at a mere 75913gp, I don't think I can turn this down.  It <em>will</em> take a bit of rearranging, though&#8230;  I swap in Galon and the Ring of Fear Resistance, stowing the Rings of Spell; I copy Essence of Speed onto one of the Amulets of Spell and pull the Spellbook of Identify out of storage. Most satisfying.  A bit of restocking, and I return to: 
</p>
<h4 id="head-b559c6f4da02e82d9e6264ca40e4eba3c346857d-2">Part 2 of 3</h4>
<p>
<strong>Orc 15</strong>, take 2 
</p>
<p>
There's a pack of Light hounds in the cavern where I enter, and they get in some pot shots at me as I get transformed into full combat mode (one of the minor annoyances of this strategy), taking me down to 127/157hp.  They don't live long enough to regret the mistake, &gt;:&gt;, but I am down to 106/157hp by the time they're all dead.  I could really use some kind of area-effect attack; maybe I'll get another relic quest soon&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
Not much of note happens for a while.  A Pseudo-dragon takes me to <em>clvl 23</em>, with skill points going 1 to Bearform-combat, 1 to Temporal, and 3 to Spell-power, bringing it up to the level+4 cap.  Essence of Speed is up to spell effect level 24, which brings my top speed in bear form up to +9. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15">  And with my new ring 'Galon', my mana regeneration rate is high enough that I can pretty much keep Essence of Speed going full time. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
Anyway, that's about it for this level; onward to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 16</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"This level can't be all bad&#8230;"  Hmm, more Light hounds nearby, and some Lizard men and Ogres beyond that. 
</p>
<p>
Not much of interest on this level.  I encountered my first Undead mass, which helped me get my piety all the way back up to -2223 (and took my CON from 15 down to 12, but it seems to be only a temporary loss).  Those Ogres dropped Padded Armor of Resist Cold [+4], which is only slightly interesting; and I found the junkart The Jester's Cap of Insanity. 
</p>
<p>
And that's pretty much it; we continue to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 17</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You feel strangely lucky&#8230;"  Nar is in the cavern where I enter, not far from me.  He's surprisingly tough to take down, what with his self-healing spells; it takes several turns to kill him, and he takes me down to 137/153hp.  The Swordsman behind him drops a Short Bow of Extra Shots (+6,+7). 
</p>
<p>
A pack of Ogres in the next room takes me to <em>clvl 24</em>; I allocate skill points 1 to Bearform-combat, 1 to Temporal, 1 to Spell-power, and 2 to Conveyance.  Essense of Speed is now up to spell effect level 25, which means my top speed in bear form is now +10. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
Further southeast, I encounter Ufthak and company, who put up essentially no resistance&#8212;except when Essence of Speed wore off at exactly the wrong moment and Ufthak had me down to 66/160hp before I could get it started again&#8230; <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/alert.png" alt="/!\" height="15" width="15">  Fortunately, Bjorn's tough enough by now to have a fairly high tolerance for that kind of freak slip-up&#8212;unlike some other characters I've played recently&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"A good craftsman never blames his tools, lad. <em>(zizz)</em>" 
</p>
<p>
Shoo! <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  I have to go through a couple !oCCW's after that thanks to a couple shamans cursing at me from the back of the pack, but otherwise I prevail. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, that's what you get for, like, using bad language, you evil witch-doctor guys!" 
</p>
<p>
Not that kind of&#8230; oh, never mind.  Ufthak dropped 19 Bolts (+4,+4), and one of his entourage dropped a Long Bow of Power (+10,+12).  And the entire gang got my piety up to -1910. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
Nothing much else of note, beyond getting my STR pasted by a Giant red scorpion (oh, and apparently, some of the CON hits from the Undead masses weren't temporary&#8230;).  I think I'm still in good enough condition, though, to push on to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 18</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You feel that you will meet your fate here.  You feel that your luck is turning&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
"Huh?  What fate?" 
</p>
<p>
Remember, we got a fate to find a Potion of Water on dlvl 18?  Well, we're here. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, yeah.  Lamest&#8230; fate&#8230; <em>ever</em>. 
</p>
<p>
I tend to agree.  Oh well, there are some Cave orcs nearby to take out our frustrations on. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15">  The prophesied useless vial turns out to be over in another corner of the very large cavern where we entered, sitting under a small pack of Black ogres.  A reward for our great efforts in slaying them, I presume. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
Next up are some Wargs and Gnome mages&#8212;and both Essence of Speed and bear form give out on me at the worst possible moment, and require several tries (and a few Phase Doors to temporary safety) to get restarted. Further battles with Black orcs (still all in this same initial cavern, mind) net a Lance of *Slay Animal* (+15,+7) (+1), and the junkart Tenser's Top-Heavy Teaspoon.  Hmm, this is getting pretty heavy; I'll probably have to recall out after I finish this level. 
</p>
<p>
Finally making it out of the starting cavern, I hit <em>clvl 25</em> fending off a pack of Half-orcs; skill points go 1 to Bearform-combat, 2 to Spell-power, and 2 to Conveyance.  My unhasted speed in bear form drops to -10, and with Essense of Speed still at spell effect level 25, my full speed in bear form drops to +9. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/sad.png" alt=":(" height="15" width="15">  My piety, though, is up to -1432. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
Near the southwest corner, I find a lesser vault (Cross), which nets a Short Bow of Power (+8,+16) and a fresh Wand of Dig to replace my nearly empty one.  To the west of that, I find a small gaggle of assorted yeeks&#8212;but no Orfax <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15">  Must be one of those <em>ad hoc</em> monster groups I've run into occasionally&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"Maybe it was, like, a yeek beer party, dude." 
</p>
<p>
Yes, Bjorn, I'm sure that was it. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  The rest of the level passes uneventfully; and since my pack is getting kind of heavy, I recall back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
After getting my stats restored and selling off the armor (the Bree armory, unlike the weapon store, has a 30Kgp cap), I head to Gondolin to sell off the weapons and *ID* the junkarts: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Jester's Cap of Insanity, activates for gain corruption 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Tenser's Top-Heavy Teaspoon, activates for decrease WIS 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
"Totally bogus.  I see why they, like, call these things 'junk' arts." 
</p>
<p>
Well, there are a few good ones, but yes, most of them seem to be useless or worse.  Also while in Gondolin, I acquire a fate to find Cord Armor on dlvl 1. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15">  On the flip side, the Gondolin Black Market has a Potion of Charisma, which takes me from 10 CHR to 12. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
Back in Bree, my prophesied armor turns out to be Cord Armor of Resist Fire [+4].  Okay, that's not so bad.  I almost immediately acquire another fate, though:  to meet a Blubbering idiot on dlvl 10. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  I wonder if it's worth ducking into the top of the Orc Cave to clear off.  Nah, maybe later. I restock and return to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 18</strong>, take 2 
</p>
<p>
First off is a pack of Black orcs and Dark hounds.  Thank Manwe for resist blindness from Galon&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"&#8216;Kay.  'Oh, mighty god dude Manwe, we thank thee for, like, the magic ring thingy that keeps me from going blind&#8230;'" 
</p>
<p>
Um, Bjorn, that was a figure of&#8230; oh, never mind.  The rest of the level goes fairly smoothly, netting me three saleable weapons: an Acidic Dagger (+6,+5) from a pack of Cave orcs, and a Specral Dagger (+8,+3) and a Broad Sword of *Slay Undead* (+8,+2) (+2) from a pack of Black ogres.  And my piety is up to -525. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15">  Onward to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 19</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You feel strangely lucky&#8230;"  No, I don't really, considering I'm kinda surrounded here, with Black orcs, Light hounds, Blink dogs and Novice rogues all clustered around me in the rather small cavern where I entered&#8212;not to mention a Giant green dragon fly.  Good thing I restarted Essence of Speed just before coming down the stairs.  I risk taking a turn to Manathrust the dragon fly, then try to Phase Door to a better tactical position.  This strategy fails spectacularly, three times landing me next to some of the monsters, before finally landing me near one of the corners of the cavern.  The Light hounds are whittling me down, and I have to keep Phase-Dooring to get away from being swamped.  Finally I land close enough to one of the room's exits to get into a corridor, from which I manage to whittle down the onslaught in comparative safety.  Loot from the carnage nets a Broad Sword of *Slay Animal* (+7,+6) (+2). 
</p>
<p>
After that harrowing start, the level proceeds uneventfully for a while, until I run into Bullroarer.  A bit out of his depth, he is, and he shows it by falling in a single turn, dropping a Metal Cap [+5], a Beaked Axe (+2,+3), and&#8230; wait for it&#8230; Thengel. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/alert.png" alt="/!\" height="15" width="15">  That one's a no-brainer to wear immediately.  From there, I complete the level without further incident and proceed to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 20</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You feel strangely lucky&#8230;"  Hmm, not much nearby but a pack of Clear hounds.  I clear them out and run into a Paladin beyond them.  Hmm, he's level 20, my Charm spell might not take&#8230; oh good, it does.  A pack of Elite uruks (Elite uruk-hai?) in the next room takes me to <em>clvl 26</em>; I allocate skill points 1 to Bearform-combat, 1 to Temporal, 1 to Spell-power, and 2 to Conveyance.  I now have eight attacks in bear form, and Essence of Speed is up to spell effect level 28, bringing my top speed in bear form back to +10. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
In the next cavern, a pack of Snotlings and Black ogres <em>finally</em> take me to <em>6 piety</em>&#8212;and by the time I finish id'ing their drops (which include a Long Sword of Slay Demon (+8,+12), a Fauchard of Slay Giant (+7,+3), and a Guisarme of *Slay Orc* (+7,+9) (+1)), I'm back below zero piety&#8230; <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  No matter; further north and east, I encounter Gorbag and company, who take me back up to 229. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/biggrin.png" alt=":D" height="15" width="15">  Gorbag drops 27 Bolts (+5,+1). 
</p>
<p>
The rest of the level proceeds without incident&#8230; well, beyond finding The Demonhorn of Gothmog in one of those pits with the tiny 'pillar' room in the middle. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/alert.png" alt="/!\" height="15" width="15">  My pack is getting awfully full, and the next level <em>is</em> Deathwatch, after all, not to mention that my Wand of Dig is tapped out.  Back, then, to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
I stow two Rings of Spell I found back on Orc 18, then head to Gondolin to sell off the rather large cache of weapons I've accumulated and *ID* my artifacts: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Metal Cap of Thengel [+12] (+3), with +3 WIS, CHA and luck and  resist confusion 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Demonhorn of Gothmog [+13] (-5), with radius-2 light, -5 CHA, see  invisible, sense demon, slow digestion, regeneration and auto-curse 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Gondolin's Black Market also has a Potion of Wisdom, which takes me from 18/10 WIS to 18/20 (oh, did I mention I'd turned off linear stats?).  Back in Bree, I mathom Gothmog, restock, and return to: 
</p>
<h4 id="head-6e9311684f7d136b09b8b26abfbda113afc51ae0-2">Part 3 of 3</h4>
<p>
<strong>Orc 20</strong>, take 2 
</p>
<p>
"This level can't be all bad&#8230;"  I enter into a corridor; Sense Monsters detscts some Elite uruks, some Forest trolls, and a Giant flea.  Better get that last one before he starts breeding&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
Not much of note happens, except for another speed-runs-out close call with a pack of Mirkwood spiders and Elite uruks&#8212;the latter of which drop a Fauchard of Slay Orc (+12,+7) and a Ring of Free Action, which I may need to use since I'll be unable to use Cammithrim.  In the next cavern, a pack of Hill orcs drops a Small Wodden Boomerang of *Slay Undead* (+2,+4) (+2). 
</p>
<p>
Now, here's where it gets interesting.  I make sure Essence of Speed is topped off, and descend to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Deathwatch</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<em>This level looks filled with evilness.</em> 
</p>
<p>
<em>*shudder*</em> "Whoa, majorly heinous, dude." 
</p>
<p>
Yeah, stay on your toes.  There are a <em>lot</em> of orcs in this amphitheater coming up; try to sneak up on them. 
</p>
<p>
"Um, dude, bears don't exactly, like, sneak&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
Mm.  The initial assault isn't as bad as I'd feared; most of the orcs don't wake up until I'm fairly close to them.  I do end up drawing most of the orcs out of the barracks to the north before I get to them, though.  Lagduf drops Ring Mail [+1] and a Three Piece Rod (+6,+4). 
</p>
<p>
On west to Grishnakh's alcove.  I position myself just below the pillar at the south end below the triangular section, so that the attackers can only come at me from two directions.  Grishnakh drops a Bastard Sword (+4,+3) and a Lucerne Hammer (+6,+5). 
</p>
<p>
Onward to the barracks north of that&#8212;and some orcs are already leaking up from Golfimbul's section in the southwest.  This barracks falls a bit more orderly than the last.  Down the west/south corridor, then, to the last nest of baddies.  Annoyingly, one of the Half-orc Rogues gets away from me (he didn't get any money, but I'll still have to track him down, just on principle).  Golfimbul alone of the Deathwatch uniques takes more than one turn to die, and he only takes two. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15">  He drops a Small Sword (+5,+5) and Chain Mail [+3]. 
</p>
<p>
The Rogue was back in the second barracks, and falls gratifyingly quickly. Back south, I punch through the stone wall with my Wand of Dig and push on to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orc 22</strong> 
</p>
<p>
"You have a good feeling&#8230;"  I'm not so sure about that; Ugluk and company are practically on top of me to my west, and there are Novice mindcrafters and a Paladin to my south.  It takes two tries to charm the Paladin.  Good thing I'm at +10 speed; the orcs beside me are starting to wake up.  A few steps north, the screen scrolls and a small pack of Ogres comes into view, along with the rest of Ugluk's entourage&#8212;with a Shrieker mushroom patch in the middle of it. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/alert.png" alt="/!\" height="15" width="15">  Oh, man, that I <em>don't</em> need&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
"Shh, quiet, little fungus guy&#8230;" 
</p>
<p>
That's not gonna help, Bjorn. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  I spend a few turns punching through the group with Manathrust to take out the Shrieker.  With that threat out of the way, I return to the fight, which should be fairly&#8211; 
</p>
<p>
<em>It breathes gas.  You are poisoned!</em> 
</p>
<p>
Oh, @#$%.  I light up the cavern (a very large open one, unfortunately) and sure enough, there's a pack of Air hounds off to the west of Ugluk's party. Not good; I'm down to 129/179hp and poisoned.  I've <em>gotta</em> start carrying that Book of Teleportation.  Okay, I think I'm close enough to the northeast corner of the cavern to get to the exits there&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
Nope, no good; I get ganged up on, and a few more breaths take me down to 64/179hp.  I Phase Door away and quaff a !oCCW, taking me back up to 95/179hp.  Now I'm closer to the southern edge of the cavern, but not close enough, and I'm getting swamped again.  Another Phase door gets me near the  southwest corner, but another breath takes me to 81/179hp.  Another two !oCCW's (with another breath in between) gets me back up to 101/179hp, and I make it to what looks like an exit in the southwest corner&#8212;and it's just a minor cubbyhole, not nearly deep enough to provide any protection:

<p>
"Dude, use the wall-blaster thing, dig in further!"

Hey, that would work!

</pre>As you can see, an Ochre jelly has followed me in; he gets the first taste of my righteous vengeance. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/devil.png" alt=">:>" height="15" width="15">  In the middle of slashing up the Air hounds that arrive next, I gain <em>clvl 27</em> and the second relic quest, again southeast of Bree and northeast of Minas Anor.  Gads, what timing. The temple dungeon, then, will be dlvls 18-22, and the monsters will be level 36 at the top and 44 at the bottom. 
</p>
<p>
"Is that bad, dude?" 
</p>
<p>
Very bad.  We won't be taking that one for a while.  I allocate skill points 1 to Bearform-combat, 1 to Temporal, 2 to Spell-power, and 1 to Conveyance. 
</p>
<p>
From there, it's just a matter of attrition, picking off monsters as they come into view around the corner.  Ugluk, it turns out, is a tough old fart; it takes seven or eight turns to whittle him down, and Essence of Speed expires in the middle of it&#8212;luckily he was stunned, and I got it back up the first try. 
</p>
<p>
After most of the monsters are gone, I cast Sense Monsters and discover that the last half-dozen or so Air hounds are hanging back; they must think I'm outside the room.  Well, let &#8216;em hang back; they can't breathe on me from back there, which gives me an opportunity to rest up and recover my mana.  Hmm, those up stairs a few squares to my southeast might be considered inside the room for the purposes of their AI.  I tunnel over to them with the Wand of Dig, and sure enough, they dutifully swarm in to be slaughtered. 
</p>
<p>
With the Air hounds taken care of, I venture out, bloodied but not bowed, to finish off the last few stragglers.  I'm at 131/191hp and 122/150 mana, and my piety is up to 1958.  Ugluk's drop, an Awl-Pike (+6,+4), is almost lost in the pile of loot from everything else.  Man, I hope this isn't an indication of what the rest of the level is going to be like&#8230;  By the way, good call with that cubbyhole strategy, Bjorn.  You probably saved our hide. 
</p>
<p>
"Well, hey, I <em>am</em>, like, the brains of the team, right, dude?" <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile4.png" alt=";)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
No comment&#8230; <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/tired.png" alt="|)" height="15" width="15">  I head out east and south, and before too long Sense Monsters picks up Azog&#8212;apparently alone. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15">  Pursuant to Murphy's Law, Essence of Speed expires the moment he gets next to me, so I Phase Door into a nearby cavern and restart it.  I venture back into the corridor and catch him coming a few squares away; I take the opportunity to plug three Manathrusts into him before he gets next to me again.  Between them, they do one star of damage to him. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/ohwell.png" alt=":\" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
Four turns later, he's down to five stars and I'm down to 85/191hp.  Hmm, evenly matched?  Not good.  I Phase Door back into the cavern to rest up, but Azog follows me.  He's down to three stars by the time he comes into view again, though; he must be bleeding pretty badly by now.  I toss back a !oCCW, bringing me up to 111/191hp.  He's one square away from me now.  On a hunch, I cast Essence of Speed again, just to make sure it doesn't expire in the middle of the fight&#8212;except it fails. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/angry.png" alt="X-(" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
<p>
He's next to me again, and I miss <em>every</em> blasted attack.  He hits me down to 99/191hp.  One more turn, though, and I smack him all the way down to zero. <em>*whew*</em>  His drops are Thrain's wand, Cord Armor [+1], a Sabre (+5,+2), and a Lucerne Hammer of Slay Demon (4,+7).  A Mummified orc further south in the cavern also drops an Indestructible Ring of Accuracy (+12).  Hmm, that would be nice to use, but I don't really think I have any ring slots to spare&#8230; 
</p>
<p>
I spend the rest of the level hyped up on panic adrenaline, but nothing of interest happens, beyond a pack of Hill trolls pushing me up to 2054 piety. With a sigh of relief, I recall back to: 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bree</strong> 
</p>
<p>
The Black Market has a Drum of Power (+2), with +2 STR and CHA, resist base plus resist light, and see invisible.  Excellent, that will let me swap out my Resistance armor for Thalkettoth.  I head over to Gondolin to sell off my accumulated ego weapons and *ID* the standard Deathwatch haul: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 The Leather Scale Mail 'Thalkettoth' [+25] (+3), with +3 DEX and speed  and resist acid, light and shards 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Leather Gloves 'Cammithrim' [+10], which activate for magic missile  (2d6) every 2 turns and have radius-1 light, sustain CON, free action and  resist light 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Main Gauche of Maedhros (2d5) (+12,+15) (+3), with +3 INT, DEX and  speed, slay troll and giant, free action, see invisible and regeneration 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
The Gondolin Black Market has a Staff of Genocide with 3 charges, which could come in handy for future use, and a Potion of Strength, which takes me from 18/30 STR to 18/50. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15">  I also buy 7 Scrolls of Recharging and read them on Thrain's wand, pumping it up to 44 charges. 
</p>
<p>
"So, like, what's the big deal about this Thrain dude's wall-blaster thing, anyway?" 
</p>
<p>
Primarily what you've just seen:  since it's an artifact, it can be recharged indefinitely, with no risk of explosion. 
</p>
<p>
"Oh, so we can, like, pump it up way high and never run out in the middle of a dungeon?" 
</p>
<p>
Precisely; charge-draining monsters will be a problem later on, though.  I sell off my now-redundant Wand of Dig and return to Bree, taking a brief detour to the Orc Cave entrance to pick off that silly Blubbering Idiot fate.  Back in Bree, the Black Market now has a Ring of Accuracy (+15); that beats the one I found in the Orc Cave, plus that one's Indestructible, so it'll sell for a lot. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15">  I stow this new ring, along with Cammithrim, Maedhros and the Staff of Genocide; Farmer Maggot's sling goes to the Mathom-house, and Thalkettoth I wear.  Five more Scrolls of Recharging bring Thrain's wand up to 59 charges.  The magic shop has a Spellbook of Greater Identify, which I buy and stow for future use; I also pick up the Book of Teleportation, as promised. 
</p>
<p>
<em>[shoves book into tight space]</em> "Dude, we're kinda running out of space in here." 
</p>
<p>
That's okay, we'll be getting a new home soon. 
</p>
<p>
"Yeah?  Where?" 
</p>
<p>
Lothlorien.  We'll be setting up there next time out, before taking on Mirkwood.
