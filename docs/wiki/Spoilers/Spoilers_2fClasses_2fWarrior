<h2 id="head-218852cd0d3f4a2711663fb44e487d91aa69a5bf">Warriors</h2>
<p>
Basic warriors have lost a lot of appeal thanks to the several weaponmastery subclasses, but the generic warrior does have some advantages the others don't. 
</p>
<h2 id="head-f1e96cc3616bfd1c92c438b4e75d5b9679ff53c7">The Basics Of Warriors</h2>
<p>
The most simple class; warriors are all about finding the most powerful weapons and using them, and usually them alone. Most warriors only use melee, but archery is perfectly possible. Because warriors need to get close to their target they will take more hits and distance attacks than others, but they have far more HP and resilience to make up for it; one hit kill attacks for mages can be quite survivable with warriors. 
</p>
<p>
The warrior starts with both extra blow abilities, and gain spread blows at Clvl25. 
</p>
<h2 id="head-a7fd9a9ff8268ab71beff497198094d62ddf881e">Basic Warrior Over A Weaponmaster Strategy</h2>
<p>
If you're being a warrior, it is probably recommended you don't put any points into any of the weaponmasteries at all (Except, of course, weaponmastery itself). Naturally, combat and weaponmastery are your primary goals. It is possible to make good use of masteries as a normal warrior however; getting both sword and hafted masteries means you'll be able to use all the powerful swords found in the game better, but be ready to use Grond should you get that far. 
</p>
<p>
The warrior's main advantage is versatility. The weaponmasters have to spend at least 50 skill points on their mastery; a warrior does not. Like all warriors, magic-device should be trained as they simply need some reliable source of trap detection and teleportation later on. Disarming varies with use on your playing style; I myself find it useful but not everyone will. Another 50 points are saved if you ignore disarming. 
</p>
<p>
With the extra skill points, warriors can make their secondary skills play a major part in their strategy and benefit from them more. Common backup to warriors are: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
Symbiosis: At lower levels this just means having an extra load of HP that may take damage from what you recieve. If trained further warriors may gain some useful abilities from their symbiote. 
</p>
</li>
    <li class="gap">
<p>
Mindcraft: A very popular choice. Mindcraft spells cover almost all the detection and teleportation spells a warrior needs, and at a very low mana price most warriors can afford. 
</p>
</li>
    <li class="gap">
<p>
Archery: Many warriors ignore archery, but when trained enough it can be of great use for enemies that you just *don't* melee, like Nazgul. Also, it can help you max combat far earlier if you put points into archery. 
</p>
</li>
    <li class="gap">
<p>
Thaumaturgy: Usually more of a utility for warriors; if they get a spell that affects all monsters in sight it can speed up fighting greatly; warriors generally kill things one at a time. It is wise to keep your spell points for breeder and summoner problems, as well as groups of hounds with nasty breaths. 
</p>
</li>
    <li class="gap">
<p>
Necromancy: at level 20 you can use necromancy to be healed every time you kill a living monster (i.e. no undead or golems, etc). In very late game this isn't very useful as most nasty monsters are undead. 
</p>
</li>
    <li class="gap">
<p>
Prayer: This is one ability basic warriors can get far more use from than the subclasses. With their extra skill points they can put their God's spells to good use. Almost all Gods are recommended except Yavanna, and with Eru you miss out on many powerful bladed weapons. 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Things for warriors to <em>avoid</em>: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
Magic To Harm: The most a warrior can expect from magic is the aforementioned detection, teleportation, and perhaps augmentation like stone skin, etc. They simply do not have enough mana to put up a long fight against tough monsters with solely magic. 
</p>
</li>
    <li class="gap">
<p>
Antimagic: Unbelievers benefit far more from this, and there are little to no advantages for a basic warrior using it. 
</p>
</li>
    <li class="gap">
<p>
Spirituality: Perhaps this is a bit harsh, but the skill modifier for warrior spirituality is too low for it to be of any use. Plus, warriors can survive curse magic far better than Sorcerors and their ilk, so this has less use. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
