People play lost souls for challenge. Are you ready to die dozens of time per hour before you can have a character dump worth seeing? Or can you even get out with the most precious treasure possible - your life? <p>
You can pass thru walls to hide from monsters, and you have full view of all monsters all the time(including invisibles) while in Mandos. USE IT! 
</p>
<p>
Stair-scumming, that is going up and down until an extremely favorable situation occurs (such as up stairs nearby, nice object nice stairs, low level monsters to kill, coaligned monsters that protect you, and the rare occurence of towns) is a favored tactic, and overused it is cheating. However lost souls tend to use this to avoid being instakilled on their first 3 turns on a level... 
</p>
<p>
One thing to watch for - after you've got used to going up and down stairs and hardly moving, your "detect traps all the time" reflex wears off, and you find yourself wandering round without DTrap. <em>This is likely to be fatal</em>. Traps at this level are very powerful. 
</p>
<p>
Town people will be leveled. This means they can instakill you if you're low level! Weaklings like the blubering idiot can block you in a shop entry long enough for you to starve. 
</p>
<p>
Potions that pseudo-identify as {good} might be a potion of detonation - quaffing it makes about 500 HP damage and maximum level of cuts(mortal wounds) to yourself. Ouch! Better find some ID method... 
</p>
<p>
Ents and some ranger types are friendly. Before you flee look for coaligned flags - coaligned groups are quite helpful in early survival, even if they die right away but it gives you an extra turn to flee. 
</p>
<p>
You may be level 50 when you get out - that is BAD for God quests(at least in 2.2.7), and might either make you miss the final quest of one of the towns or be summoned from the halls of Mandos to that quest around character level 45(as verified in old 2.x.x versions). It also makes beastmaster quests ridiculously harder when you get them... 
</p>
<p>
Picking weak monsters with manatrust has been a favored way for some people to level here. 
</p>
<p>
You're more likely to die 100 times in a row before you get an armor with any resists; so to get out of Mandos unless you use stair-scumming somewhat, or tricks like making a potion of detonation(alchemist) and killing a level 15 critter as your first kill(you'll gain 15+ levels doing that). 
</p>
<p>
Summoners and possessors sound nice, but trying to get a nice corpse in Mandos can be difficult - unless you stair-scum for coaligneds and take the corpses of whoever loses. The rewards however are nice since those are corpses well above your character level. 
</p>
<p>
There are no uniques or quests in Mandos. However some joke/Cthulhu/Angband monsters might seem insanely overpowered in Mandos since they're leveled. 
</p>
<p>
save game cheating can't really save you in Mandos; you will often simply starve to death and having 20 save games of your progress can't save you. Regeneration costs food and having this advantage will kill slower but with more certainty than without regeneration. 
</p>
<p>
Lost soul bard yeeks are arguably one of the hardest characters to win with, even if you get out of Mandos! But I heard it has been done by some famed players; I dare you to make it with persistent rooms on(no stair scumming for nearby upstairs)! 
</p>
<p>
-Da Alchemist, player of 300+ Mandos characters and savior of none! 
</p>
<p>
Simon: Super-patient stair scumming can get you to any dungeon level before fighting your first monster so it's a matter of how long you scum or a matter of a mandos-specific character creation strategy like deathmold sorcerers who are almost easy! 
</p>
<p>
Disarming traps in mandos is a meaningless death wish so go thru walls instead. A single trapped chest can kill your full-HP level 22 character! 
</p>
<hr size="3">
 <p>
Items to use to gain your first few levels as a Lost Soul: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Find a ranged attack! Arrows &amp; bow, manatrust, wands &amp; recharge, anything you can reuse! 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Find a set of dragon scale mail and use the breath weapon (but be warned, activating it will be tough) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Find any one of a number of wands or rod tip/rod combinations for area effects (ditto) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Find any one of a number of artifacts (tritto) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 unlock some doors and stair-scum repeatedly for 1 XP each. 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Monsters that are really nice as your first kill: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Vortexes. Except the kind that has an aura that hurts you when you hit them. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Death Molds (just don't get next to them) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Light hounds, arriving one by one by a corner. Especially if you have light resist (like most elf-types) 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Monsters to watch out for as a Lost Soul: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Death Drakes 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Death Quasits 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Dreads, Dreadlords, Dreadmasters 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Everything else 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
Long-term extremely useful items for Lost Souls: 
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Items of speed 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 All the AC, to-hit, and to-dam items you can find. Even the cursed helm of Gorlim(+25,+25) cold imm permacurse is good! 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Robes of Permanence, sustain items (prevents your CON from going down to 3 and staying there. Don't worry about CHA) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 resists. They save you from Z's and other breathers. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 The Rod Tip of Home Summoning (both of the Lost Souls I have played have found this before escaping, interestingly enough) 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Any item that lets you identify, especially a rod tip of perception 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 Items of Genocide and *Destruction*. Especially randarts. The HP cost of genocide is based on monster count, not on monster level thank God! 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 If you're amazingly lucky (I'm not), Power Dragon Scale Mail 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
And a note: unique never show up in Mandos unless summoned by some other monster(I don't think any nonunique can summon a unique... not sure).  Now, this doesn't sound like that huge an advantage: but it lets you clean up entire vaults and loot items if you have enough HP to survive using a genocide scoll.
