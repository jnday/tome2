Alchemy doesn't use mana, doesn't care about INT or WIS (except for getting artifact creation, and that's needed only once and easy), so a warrior-race is one good choice. Ent (for grow trees and no mana penalty) or zombie Troll alchemists are nice. <p>
WIS and INT may become important in mid to late game if you get enough thaumaturgy from lost sword quests to specialize in it (alchemists have no other way to really deal with high level chain summoners); but when you do you'll be able to create artifacts to max all your stats anyways. 
</p>
<p>
Weaponmastery and alchemy are the two recommended skills to max out; magic device is very nice too but doesn't need maxing in mid or late game (alternative: take Thaumaturgy instead if lost sword quests give you a decent modifier, and max it. Use lost sword quests for a few magic device points). 
</p>
<p>
First thing to learn is they can make lots of money quick: <a href="./Spoilers_2fClasses_2fAlchemist_2fMoney">/Money</a> 
</p>
<p>
Midgame you'll want to know how good your ego items can get; look here <a href="./Spoilers_2fClasses_2fAlchemist_2fMaxes">/Maxes</a> 
</p>
<p>
About their late-game artifact creation ability, look at <a href="./Spoilers_2fClasses_2fAlchemist_2fFirst_20Artifact">/First Artifact</a> 
</p>
<p>
-As your first action wear your gloves, make a potion of detonation and sell it. Buy enchant armor/damage scrolls and leech essences. Repeat. Think about not selling the last potion and throwing it at a 2-headed hydra for 20 fast levels (NOT good for making sure you have all God quest or easy beastmaster first quest, but oh so neat!) 
</p>
<p>
-Make lots of curing and other useful potions to survive your first few levels! 
</p>
<p>
-At level 2 you can have alchemy level 5. You should brand your weapon, uncurse and extract essences to retry if cursed. You can optimize your weapon by many attempts every 5 or 10 levels if you like. You should use enchant weapon-type scrolls before you add an ego, and after if possible (if not practical, just try again in 5 levels). The shocking ego is the one most monsters are the less likely to be resistant to. Also, get "of fearlessness" on your lantern ASAP! 
</p>
<p>
-Ego lights ("torch of fearlessness", etc) are never cursed and are very cheap to make. Use (requires alchemy level 5+) to get you cash-started if almost out of cash. 
</p>
<p>
-You can extract all essences from a wand and make a better wand with those essences - just create the wand in a deep dungeon and make 20+ attempts to get a really good one. Then you can add 1000 essences to it if you want. Just beware of monsters that heal themselves by draining your wands and some traps. As stated before, thaumaturgy is a superior option if you get a decent learning rate from lost sword quests. 
</p>
<p>
-You can max your stats mid-game by *ID* of stat potions (especially the augmentation potion of the spider quest to cover all previous oversights) and mass production of such potions. All you need is some magic essences (leech *ID* scrolls a lot) and every other essence can be leeched from something cheap in town. Don't do this very early as you need some skill so the potion doesn't go boom and kill a very low level character! 
</p>
<p>
-Farmer Maggot's vicious dogs can be killed and the quest left failed - just don't talk to Maggot again and you can farm the mushroom field repeatedly (with &lt; and &gt; to regenerate the mushrooms if you're a cheater - saves time on a boring task). The mushroom field becomes nearly useless at the level where the quest is easy to win, so you might as well win the quest anyway (throw potions of sleep at the dogs or wall them off or something). 
</p>
<p>
-There are many nifty gauntlets and cesti you can wear in this game - but you'll prefer leather gloves because they're necessary for alchemy. In the orc caves you'll find some nice artifact gloves! 
</p>
<p>
-Rods are nearly useless in mid- and late-game to attack. But they are nice utilities. You can use most spell-effects in the game, save for God-type effects from your wands/staves/rods, but high spell power from an artifact you make with some ordinary attack SPELL (no sticks!) is quite powerful, too. Manathrust (from worshipping Eru) is nice for that. Spell power doesn't help with thaumaturgy. 
</p>
<p>
-Keep every filthy rag and rabbit corpse you get, INTACT, otherwise you'll have to hunt for days and days of game time for those when you get artifact creation. Rabbit feet even have their own FAQ at <a href="./Spoilers_2fClasses_2fAlchemist_2fRabbit_20Feet_20Faq">/Rabbit Feet Faq</a>! An ancient dragon corpse of some kind is useful too (one black, one white, two blue, two red to cover 4 immunities and the 2 auras). Keep corpses of greater demon/undead summoners (hard to find, sometimes you may even want to use the scroll of mass resurection to get another chance at the Santa Claus unique) to brand your weapon. 
</p>
<p>
-If you get the great rod tip of home summoning, you can zap it in each dungeon town for an extra home in that town you can't otherwise have!! This is useful for storing, say, 20 troll corpses to fix that oversight with +% life after you get a pval of 20 on an artifact you make.

<strong><a href="./FeathinSilyar">FeathinSilyar</a></strong>: Shouldn't all these other alchemy spoiler pages be subpages of this one, rather than independent floating pages?  Like <a href="./Spoilers_2fClasses_2fAlchemist_2fMoney">/Money</a> rather than [<a href="./AlchemistSpoilersMoney">AlchemistSpoilersMoney</a>].
