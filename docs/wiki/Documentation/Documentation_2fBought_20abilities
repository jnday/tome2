 <h2 id="head-2e70e399a4dd69eac0bab15f073cd5551832dae7">"Bought" abilities</h2>
As well as spending your skill points on skills, you can also choose to spend them on abilities. Abilities are bought once, and then have a permanent effect. You cannot  continue adding skill points into them, (which you can with skills) as there would be no way that these abilities can improve. They are a "one-off purchase". <p>
As a consequence of this, they are often quite powerful abilities and can cost quite a few skill points to buy. Most abilities have a prerequisite skill or stat level which you must reach before being able to buy. 
</p>
<p>
For instance, you can invest in the Tree-walking ability. This will allow you to pass through dense undergrowth. In order to purchase this skill, you must first have your Nature skill at 20 or greater, and then it will cost you 7 skill points to buy. This means you have to "save up" enough skill points in order to be able to afford this ability. 
</p>
<p>
You can access the Ability screen by pressing 'N'. Scroll up and down the abilities and then navigate right to buy selected ability. 
</p>
<p>
Adapt your character with skills and abilities in order to make it unique, playable, and maybe even powerful enough to win the game! 
</p>
<p>
Here follows a list of all the available abilities for 2.2.x. For a conversion table between linear and percentile stats, see the relevant entry in the <a href="./FrequentlyAskedQuestions">FrequentlyAskedQuestions</a>.

<a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a>: Ooooh, we have a problem here. The above are abilities, but where do we describe (and what do we label) 'abilities' like Trapping, Artifact Creation, Tree-walking, etc? Or do we rename this page, or????? <p>
<a href="./SoulWynd">SoulWynd</a>: If they're done, you could link directly to them or if not, I think they should be a subpage of this one. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a>: I disagree. This page came from the "starting abilities" portion of birth.txt. Actual abilities (e.g. trapping) are denoted in ability.txt. 
</p>
<p>
Trapping, etc. need to be bought in order to acquire them, which makes them <em>very</em> different from the basic game abilities. It's illogical to put bought abilities as a subpage to birth abilities, not to mention potentially very confusing to someone new to the game. 
</p>
<p>
The question is, what do we call the abilities on this page. "Those things you see on the first page of the character sheet"? (Okay, that was tongue in cheek.) Birth Abilities? Birth Attributes? Basic Abilities? Essential Abilities? Essential Attributes? Primary Abilities? (But then attributes are STR, INT....) 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./SoulWynd">SoulWynd</a>: Hard call there. They are somewhat a mix of abilities with skills. Maybe General Abilities, or General Skills? 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a>: Exactly...it's a hard call. Skills are something different again, I wouldn't go that route. (I added a few more ideas to my previous post.)  
</p>
<p>
Let's see here...time for a thesaurus. Synonyms/related words for 'ability' that might (possibly) work: talent, aptitude, mastery, competency, proficiency. 
</p>
<p>
Another way to do this would be to have the fork on this page -- both the birth abilities and bought abilities, in a tree, (rather than having one as a subpage) e.g.  
</p>

    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Birth abilities 
</p>
</li>

        <ul>

        <li>
<p>
 fighting 
</p>
</li>
        <li>
<p>
 shooting 
</p>
</li>
        <li>
<p>
 ... etc .... 
</p>
</li>

        </ul>


    <li>
<p>
 Bought abilities 
</p>
</li>

        <ul>

        <li>
<p>
 Trapping 
</p>
</li>
        <li>
<p>
 Tree-walking 
</p>
</li>
        <li>
<p>
 ... etc .... 
</p>
</li>

        </ul>    </ul>


<p>
But that preferably as last ditch. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./NeilStevens">NeilStevens</a>: They just need to be renamed from abilities on the ToME side.  Renaming it here without being synced there won't do any good.  It's the illustrious maintainer who's input is needed here. 
</p>
<p>
Since the words skills and abilities are already taken, though, the only word left I think is talents. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a>: I was thinking talent or competency, but the fewer syllables the better, IMHO. So which group is going to be renamed to talents? The bought abilities? 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./NeilStevens">NeilStevens</a>: I would let the ToME-native abilities keep the name ability. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a>: In the meantime, I'll just put the fork on this page, and split it up later once something is done about it on the ToME side. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="./NeilStevens">NeilStevens</a></strong>: With ToME 2.3 I've made the internal abilities a lot less important.  Hopefully they're on the way to just disappearing from the UI. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a></strong>: Works for me. However, I have a question: Shall the wiki documentation be backwards-compatible, once we shift to 2.3 and beyond? 
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="./NeilStevens">NeilStevens</a></strong>:  I don't think so.  What reason don't people have to upgrade? 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./ChrisAmes">ChrisAmes</a>: Maybe I'm just sticking my nose where it doesn't belong (I'm just a standard player) but I think the wiki shouldn't be backwards compatible. However, people might not want to upgrade because they didn't like the new changes. 
</p>

        <ul>

  <strong><a href="./NeilStevens">NeilStevens</a></strong>: People who choose not to upgrade because they don't like the differences shoudln't need to have the differences documented, I say. <p>
  <strong><a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a></strong>: True, but what about folks who haven't upgraded yet for other reasons? For example, I haven't gotten the 2.3 CVS yet, because I want to win the game with my current character.    Maybe it's time to run another one of those "what version are you playing" polls. Not to inform any decision about the wiki, but just for the sake of reference. 
</p>
<p>
  <strong><a href="./NeilStevens">NeilStevens</a></strong>: 2.3 isn't out yet.  Once 2.3 is out, then 2.2 documentation on here is obsolete. People who don't move to it after finishing current characters are on their own.  Keeping 2.2 documentation is no more useful as accepting 2.2 bug reports. 
</p>

        </ul>


<p>
<a href="./MassimilianoMarangio">MassimilianoMarangio</a>: There could be a file with the major changes that affect gameplay (e.g. skill changes, new spells, new special levels, etc.) without bugfixes, typos etc. 
</p>

    <ul>

 <strong><a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a></strong>: Uh.... I thought that was already in each release? 
    </ul>


<p>
<a href="./MassimilianoMarangio">MassimilianoMarangio</a>: Yes, but the major changes are perhaps not easily found. I meant to delete all the small fixes and corrections and to better describe the major gameplay changes. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a></strong>: That seems like a good solution.
