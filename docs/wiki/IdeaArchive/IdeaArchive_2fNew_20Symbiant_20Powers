 <a href="./RavenRed">RavenRed</a>: Just a few ideas about one of my favourite concepts but underpowered classes... <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15"> 
    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 Attacks - Greater levels of the Mimic Skill should allow additional attacks by your symbiote during melee, as well as more powerful attacks. Perhaps a new "set" of attacks (not a single attacks, but an entirely new "round" of attacks} should be available every 16 levels. (i.e. 3x a symbiote's usual number of attacks by L48). A dice bonus of +1/+1 (toh/tod) every 12 levels also wouldn't be too OTT. This makes even the humble white jelly a deadly tool in the hands of a master Symbiant! <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15"> 
</p>
</li>
    <li class="gap">
<p>
 Extend Psudopod - Far-Reaching attack for Symbiotes. A low level attack which gives your symbiote a free hit at someone a pace or two off... 
</p>
</li>
    <li class="gap">
<p>
 Sarcifice Symbiote - Your Symbiote EXPLODES, killing itself and exploding for HP Force damage in a radius of SKILL/5. Also reduces your HP by 10%. Doesn't sound impressive? Well if you think that a Master Q has potentially 3000HP...  
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
2cworth and counting...  
</p>
<p>
Christoper: Sybiants aren't underpowered in my opionion. Though that sacraficing one to explode it sounds not only cool, but pretty balanced as well (in my opionion). Just my 3c. (That's inflation for you) 
</p>
<p>
Simon: considering the symbiant might have 2 or 3 houses full of hypnotized symbiotes, and getting new ones is as simple as going to Angband and reading piles of scrolls, sacrificing a symbiant shouldn't be THAT powerful. Symbiants would have some otherwise throwaway symbiants, or a multiplying-capable-symbiant, just to supply them with endless range 10 "grenades"... 
</p>
<p>
Overpowered. But cool if we make it less powerful! Remember how genocide was defanged by making it not gain XP and lose that many HP? Exploding a part of your own symbiosed body should be painful. (-; 
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="./NeilStevens">NeilStevens</a></strong>: Symbiants aren't wanting for power.  Make good use of scrolls of summon never-moving pet in the right places.  Once you get a good Quylthulg you're set.  Once a Master Q it should be all over. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="./SoulWynd">SoulWynd</a></strong>: I wouldn't mind new powers and abilities in every skill. As long as they're meaningful and worthwhile it's all good. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./RavenRed">RavenRed</a>: I'm seeking a way to use Symbiants without having to use summoning / chain-summoning, as either melee or other spellcaster. Perhaps "underpowered, if one leaves aside summoning" (which should come as no surprise to people who know my opinions on the  current implementation of summoning). Death Swords/Molds are all right as Melee, but I'm just looking at other ways of playing symbiants.  
</p>
<p>
<a href="./DarkGod">DarkGod</a>: The idea of symbiosis is to be in .. well .. symbiosis, not to cary a personal thermo-nuclear bomb... You do NOT make your best friend explode.. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="./NeilStevens">NeilStevens</a></strong>: Perhaps poor, killed symbiotes should be listed in the character sheet in the way poor, killed companions are now. 
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a></strong>: I like that idea, Neil. I would even augument that to include hypnotized symbiotes which were destroyed out of hand, rather than dropped and released. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./RavenRed">RavenRed</a>: <a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a>, did you mean in terms of dying from enemy action or from the theorised "brutally explode your friend" power? BTW, on reflection DG, I agree. After all, it's SHARING your body more than anything else. Although a modified power costing foo percent of BOTH your maximum hp might be fairer. That way, it's a proportionate loss to both of you...  
</p>
<p>
Christopher: re:darkgod, why not make your best friend explode? Sometimes even best friends must part for life... or death rather. Anyway demonology has a spell like that, doesn't it?  
</p>
<p>
Simon: in many other games, summoning is limited by a factor depending on the character's charisma; going over the limit is either impossible or causes some/all summoned monsters to turn against you(so the symbiosis-using summoner with summoning skill &lt; 2 or charisma &lt; 10 could only control weak monsters). Taking in account the level of the summoned monster helps a lot. 
</p>
<p>
Idea of new symbiant power: symbiote melee. A melee style where your weapon slot in unavailable, but you get a melee attack based on your symbiote's attacks augmented by symbiosis skill(or penalised by lack of symbiosis skill). So having a powerful symbiote but a symbiosis skill of 1 wouldn't be so overpowered...
