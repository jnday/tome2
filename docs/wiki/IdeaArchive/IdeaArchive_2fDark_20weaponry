<a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a>: I don't know if Unbelievers and Dark weapons are going to remain in 3.0, but if they are... <p>
There should be more dark weapons than just swords, shouldn't there?  
</p>
<p>
Somewhere on the forum, someone draws a parallel between dark swords and a series of sf books, I forget which one. But if we keep the dark weapon idea, I don't see why it should be limited to swords. Perhaps dark hafted items or whatever might be very rare, but they should exist. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./amaurea">amaurea</a>: I am sure I read about dark as an ego type in the forums. Sounds reasonable to me. Each piece of dark equipment should help the antimagic skill. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./NerdanelVampire">NerdanelVampire</a>: In the case anyone cares about ToME conforming to Weis &amp; Hickman (I don't), it would be perfectly in-theme to have antimagical versions of every weapon (made of metal anyway). The reason that all the antimagical weapons were swords in Darksword Trilogy, was that there was only one antimagical weapon... 
</p>
<p>
I've been thinking for a good while now that antimagic should be an ego type. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./ZV">ZV</a>: yeah, but I think it's better to have some other name for it. 'dark' isn't in theme nor the word has any connection to 'generating antimagic field'. Maybe 'galvorn'? Though it doesn't seem to be antimagical in Sil, but at least is in theme (and it's dark-coloured metal :p ) 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./MassimilianoMarangio">MassimilianoMarangio</a>: What about Eog ? From the description of Eog golems: 
</p>

    <ul>

 <em>It is a massive deep brown statue, striding towards you with an all-too-familiar purpose.</em>  <em> Your magic surprisingly feels much less powerful now. </em> 
    </ul>


<p>
<a href="./NeilStevens">NeilStevens</a>: If you replace Dark Swords with a Dark ego type, you make Unbelievers weaker.   What's the point?   I see the word "should" a lot here.  When you all say "should," are you thinking of theme or game?  Keep the game first in mind always or you'll make it less fun. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a>: Well, when I used the word "should" in this thread, I used it in the sense of "how about this idea?", <em>NOT</em> "what exists now is wrong and therefore must be replaced by what I am suggesting."  
</p>
<p>
If only Unbelievers can effectively use Dark items, then why does it matter whether the Dark item is a sword or a &lt;insert weapon type here&gt;? I don't see how it could weaken Unbelievers -- would you explain, please? I guess I'm missing something here. <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":)" height="15" width="15">  
</p>
<p>
I was thinking of the game. I thought it might be fun to see an Unbeliever win the game with Haftedmastery &amp; a Dark Axe or some such. Somehow my minds' eye always puts an axe in an Unbeliever's hand; it just seems to fit. (Keep in mind that I've never read the Darksword Trilogy, so I'm coming at it from a different viewpoint than some people here.)  
</p>
<p>
I don't want to see the game littered with Dark items (see my original post), just thought it might make for a nice variation... and I wondered how antimagic and Haftedmastery would combine, especially w/ Far-Reaching attack being available. (Dark Lance? &lt;g&gt;) 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./NeilStevens">NeilStevens</a>: If Dark takes up an ego slot, then Unbelievers can't get a double-ego Dark Sword.  That's one way you make them weaker.  The other way is that a relatively light 3d7 starting weapon is a major advantage of Unbelievers which is lost if the base type goes away.  Yes, unbelievers only get maximal benefits with one weapon type, but that one type is a very good one. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a>: Urrrr... Okay, I don't really understand your explanation (what on earth is a double-ego Dark Sword?!), but thank you, and I cheerfully grant that a very valid reason exists. 
</p>
<p>
This may be a dumb question, but could other Dark weapons exist without making Dark an Ego tag? 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./NeilStevens">NeilStevens</a>: You know what an ego item is?  It's a special kind of item with a special name (Melting, of Speed, whatever) that gives special flags.  There are two kinds of ego items, prefix and suffix.  An item can only have two ego types as a result.  Right now, a Dark Sword can get two ego types added (perhaps Elemental Dark Sword of Gondolin), but if we make Dark an Ego type, then the best you could get is, say, Dark Rapier of Gondolin. 
</p>
<p>
If we add new dark weapons, then we get the problem you alluded to earlier: weapon dilution.  We'd end up littering the game with weapons useless to all classes but one. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./MayLith">MayLith</a>: Forgive me please, Neil. Maybe you haven't figured it out yet, but I'm a tetch dyslexic. Yes, I do know what ego items are, and yes, I've seen double-ego items MANY times before, now that you've described those with that label. When I hear "a double-ego dark sword", what I *think* is "A Dark Sword of Dark". (And yes, that's dumb, but there ya go.) Thank you for explaining. 
</p>
<p>
More questions, just for the sake of discussion, as I don't know the limits of the code: Is it possible, in the current setup, to get an Elemental Dark Axe of Gondolin? Yes, it might weapon dilution (and I don't want that) but, seems to me that's no more dilution than encountering non-blessed weapons with an Eru-worshipper, or a crossbow for someone specializing in regular bows, etc. Where do you draw the line? (Again, I'm fine w/ it the way it is, just seeking more information.) 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./NerdanelVampire">NerdanelVampire</a>: I think the antimagic ego (whatever you decide to call it) should give more than just the antimagic. I'm mainly thinking of more dice and dice sides, like slaying but better. There could also be an *antimagic* ego. You shouldn't need two additional egos with that kind of thing. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./RavenRed">RavenRed</a>: There was a thread with me and Ingeborg discussing this on the forum. I created a rather crude "of Unmagic" weapon-type (in the Scripts section on [www.t-o-m-e.net] and Ingeborg refined it considerably (this is somewhere in the forums). In regards to gameplay, I think it works well. It gives Unbelievers flexibility. As for weapons that are useless to any other class... well Magestaves and Demonswords come to mind as weapons which are very class-specific. As an ego-type, additional dark-weapons extend the POSSIBLE class specialisations considerably. Darkswords ARE excellent weapons, but I sometimes find it dull that they're the ONLY appropriate weapons for Unbelievers. And if they are a rare ego-type, I'm sure they won't be too annoying an [excellent] item for unbelievers to find. 2cworth and counting... 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./NeilStevens">NeilStevens</a>: When an Eru-follower meets a non-blessed weapon, that's not dilution.  That's a deliberate penalty of that class.  Dilution is when items appear that are useless to every class but one or two (as with essences or runes).  Most characters use at least a little magic or some magic devices, so Dark weapons are useless to nearly all non-Unbelievers (or Swordmasters played as unbelievers). 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./NerdanelVampire">NerdanelVampire</a>: I view potential antimagic ego as somewhat similar to having Ancient Foul Curse on a nice artifact weapon. If my idea of antimagic increasing dice and dice sides (and possibly even doing other things) passes, a melee type character might carry an antimagical weapon as a swap for tough fights and magical opponents. Antimagical weapons of *antimagic* (if such exist) could potentially be highly powerful and correspondingly highly rare and deep, and give even unskilled characters noticeable, if far from perfect, antimagical protection. 
</p>
<p>
Also, I don't think antimagic and magic should necessarily be as strictly opposed on a same character as they are now. This isn't Weis &amp; Hickman after all. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./RavenRed">RavenRed</a>: Neil &gt; "so Dark weapons are useless to nearly all non-Unbelievers (or Swordmasters played as unbelievers).", Wheras Dark Weapons as an ego-type would permit hafted-masters, axe-masters and polearm-masters to play as unbelievers too. It's an expansion of the usefulness of the skill to other classes, and increases other ways of playing unbelivers. <a class="nonexistent" href="./NerandelVampire">NerandelVampire</a>: I'd keep the oppositional nature of Antimagic as it is, although using it as a temporary Meta-School spell effect might be nice.  
</p>
<p>
<a href="./NeilStevens">NeilStevens</a>: Why do we care whether the skill is expanded in this way? 
</p>
<p>
<a href="./RavenRed">RavenRed</a>: For extra-fun gameplay, of course! <img src="./wiki/rightsidebar/img/smile.png" alt=":-)" height="15" width="15"> For different ways of playing the game and multiplying the wonderful varations that have made ToME the Roguelike of choice for the discerning *band-er...
